# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product name
Pokémon Champions Competitive Data Platform

## Document status
Draft v1.1

## Problem statement
Competitive Pokémon Champions data is fragmented across canonical game sources, format-specific balance sources, and tournament/team archives. Analysts, creators, and players must manually gather and normalize this information before they can run useful competitive analysis.

## Product vision
Provide a single, trustworthy, and regularly updated data product for Pokémon Champions that combines canonical game data, format-specific rule/balance data, and tournament usage intelligence.

## Goals
- Create one unified dataset with stable schemas and documented lineage.
- Reduce manual data collection effort for users by at least 80%.
- Enable repeatable analysis for legality, balance deltas, usage trends, and team composition patterns.
- Publish predictable update cadences aligned with format and tournament changes.
- Deliver dashboard analytics for rapid metagame monitoring and decision support.

## Non-goals
- Building a full public consumer-facing battle simulator.
- Real-time ingestion of every live match.
- Replacing source-of-truth ownership from original platforms.

## Target users
- **Competitive analysts**: need clean, queryable historical and current metagame data.
- **Content creators**: need reliable trend snapshots and supporting stats.
- **Team builders/coaches**: need legal pool validation, usage patterns, and matchup context.
- **Internal product teams**: need stable data contracts for downstream dashboards or tools.

## Success metrics
- Dataset freshness SLA met in >=95% of scheduled updates.
- <=1% critical schema/data integrity errors per monthly release.
- >=70% reduction in ingestion-to-analysis lead time for internal users.
- Adoption: at least 3 recurring downstream consumers in first phase.

## Scope
### In scope (Phase 1)
- Source ingestion from:
  - PokéAPI (canonical data)
  - OP.GG Pokémon Champions (format-specific balance/legal pool)
  - MunchStats (tournament and team data)
- Normalized core entities:
  - Pokémon, forms, canonical stats, Champions stats, stat deltas, legal status
  - Tournament event, player, team, team member, placements
- Change-tracking layer:
  - Canonical vs Champions stat deltas
  - Daily legality snapshots for the OP.GG legal pool
- Documentation:
  - Data dictionary
  - Source lineage and extraction notes
  - Refresh cadence, release package contents, and known limitations
- Dashboard analytics module:
  - KPI overview cards (usage, win-rate proxies, legality changes)
  - Trend views by regulation window and tournament period
  - Drill-down by Pokémon, team core, move, and item usage

### Out of scope (Phase 1)
- PokéBase app ingestion
- Limitless ingestion
- Victory Road ingestion
- Advanced predictive modeling APIs
- Full web application UX
- Community write-back/edit workflows

## Functional requirements
1. System must ingest each in-scope source into staging with source timestamp metadata.
2. System must normalize records into consistent IDs and join keys.
3. System must store both canonical values and Champions-modified values where relevant.
4. System must expose regulation-aware legality fields by snapshot date.
5. System must preserve tournament provenance (event/source/date) for all team and placement records.
6. System must produce exportable flat files for analysis use (CSV/JSON).
7. System must publish schema and field definitions with every release.
8. System must provide dashboard-ready aggregate tables for trend and ranking visualizations.
9. System must support filtered dashboard analytics by regulation, date range, and tournament tier.
10. System must publish a versioned release manifest and changelog for every dataset release.
11. System must enforce documented release gates for coverage, null-rate, duplicate-key, and referential-integrity checks.

## Non-functional requirements
- **Reliability**: deterministic transformations; reproducible outputs.
- **Traceability**: every record mapped to source and extraction run.
- **Maintainability**: modular extraction/transformation steps per source.
- **Compliance**: no unauthorized redistribution of protected content; attribution retained.

## User stories
- As an analyst, I can compare canonical vs Champions stats by Pokémon and form.
- As a team builder, I can filter legal Pokémon by current regulation and item constraints.
- As a creator, I can query top-used cores and moves from recent tournaments.
- As a data consumer, I can trust that each field has clear definitions and provenance.
- As a competitive strategist, I can use dashboards to monitor usage and trend shifts without manual data prep.

## Milestones
1. **M1 – Data contract definition**
   - Finalize schema, primary keys, join keys, provenance rules, and release package contract.
2. **M2 – Source ingestion baseline**
   - Land repeatable extraction for PokéAPI, OP.GG, and MunchStats.
3. **M3 – Normalization and delta layer**
   - Deliver canonical-vs-Champions diff outputs.
4. **M4 – Tournament enrichment**
   - Integrate event/team/player structures.
5. **M5 – Release readiness**
   - Publish v1 dataset package, manifest, changelog, and documentation.
6. **M6 – Dashboard analytics release**
   - Launch first-party analytics dashboard views on top of v1 dataset outputs.

## Risks and mitigations
- **Source structure changes** → Add source-specific validation checks and fallback parsing.
- **Data licensing/usage ambiguity** → Track attribution and limit distribution scope where required.
- **ID mismatches across sources** → Maintain mapping tables and confidence flags.
- **Coverage gaps in tournament data** → Use multi-source triangulation and completeness scoring.

## Open questions
- Which downstream interface is prioritized first (files only vs query endpoint)?
- What governance is needed for schema versioning and deprecations?
- Which dashboard tool stack and hosting model should be used for Phase 1?
