-- Backlog #15's softer intermediate step: archetype_pokemon_map is a
-- curated, NOT-sourced seed (dbt/seeds/schema.yml) -- someone's editorial
-- judgment about which Pokémon belong to which archetype, not derived
-- from real co-occurrence data. Rather than replacing it outright with
-- full clustering (a bigger, separate ask this item also names), this
-- flags -- doesn't fail the build over -- archetypes whose curated
-- members don't actually show above-chance real team synergy with each
-- other, using pokemon_team_synergy's lift (backlog #9) as the "observed
-- cluster" signal to compare against.
--
-- Per archetype: avg_intra_group_lift averages pokemon_team_synergy.lift
-- across every unordered pair of the archetype's own curated members
-- (lift is symmetric, so averaging both mirrored directions doesn't skew
-- it). A pair that has never co-occurred on a real tournament team at all
-- has no pokemon_team_synergy row -- left join preserves that pair as
-- NULL rather than silently dropping it, so an archetype whose members
-- simply never appear together doesn't get treated the same as one with
-- no data at all.
--
-- drift_status:
--   insufficient_data  -- fewer than 2 curated members: no pair exists to judge
--   no_observed_pairs  -- every curated pair has zero real co-occurrence
--   drifted            -- avg lift <= 1.0: real co-occurrence is no better
--                          than chance would predict
--   aligned            -- avg lift > 1.0: members really do pair up more
--                          than their individual popularity would predict
--
-- severity=warn (this test's own config, not meta.category): a curated
-- archetype not matching observed data is real signal worth surfacing,
-- not a data-quality defect that should fail `dbt build`/CI the way an
-- actual duplicate key or referential-integrity violation would.
