-- Win-rate-proxy KPI (docs/todo.md's Phase 3 tier/record/item follow-up
-- item; docs/prd.md's "KPI overview cards (usage, win-rate proxies, ...)"):
-- aggregates each team's reported win/loss record across every roster slot
-- that included the Pokémon, restricted to the current legal pool and to
-- teams MunchStats actually reported a record for.
--
-- wilson_lower_bound (backlog.md #13) is the lower bound of a 95% Wilson
-- score confidence interval on win_rate, using record_count as the sample
-- size. Fixes the ordering a raw win_rate ranking gets wrong: a 100% win
-- rate over 3 recorded matches currently outranks 62% over 200, even
-- though the latter is the far more reliable number. wilson_rank orders by
-- this instead of raw win_rate; win_rate/record_count stay as reported so
-- consumers that want the raw proxy still have it.
