-- Move drill-down (docs/todo.md's Phase 3 tier/record/item follow-up item;
-- docs/prd.md's "Drill-down by Pokémon, team core, move, and item usage"):
-- usage count per Pokémon x move, unnesting tournament_team_member's
-- pipe-delimited moves list, restricted to the current legal pool and to
-- roster slots that reported a move list.
--
-- move_share is usage_count's fraction of that Pokémon's own total move
-- rows (dashboard "percentages, not raw counts" ask), the same
-- share-of-own-total pattern pokemon_usage_summary.usage_share and
-- pokemon_item_usage.item_share use.
--
-- move_type/power/accuracy/category/priority/pp/short_effect are joined
-- from move_detail (PokéAPI move detail) for the Pokémon Profile's Moves
-- section and the Matchup tab's damage calculator; all nullable when that
-- lookup didn't resolve.
