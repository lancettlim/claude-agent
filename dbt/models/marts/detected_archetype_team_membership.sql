-- Experimental team-to-archetype assignments. A team matches an archetype
-- when it contains at least one of that archetype group's qualifying core
-- triples. The strongest match is primary. One secondary/hybrid assignment
-- is retained only when its score is within 90% of the primary score, so a
-- team is not forced into a single identity when two cores describe it
-- almost equally well.
