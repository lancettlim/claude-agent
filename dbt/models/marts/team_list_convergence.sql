-- Top Teams tab's "Converged lists" feed: one row per canonical Limitless
-- team-list id, ranked by how many distinct players fielded that same
-- six-Pokémon composition. Answers a question no other mart does -- not
-- "which Pokémon were popular" but "which whole *compositions* did the
-- field independently converge on".
--
-- Champions scoping: this deliberately does NOT read
-- int_champions_roster, and that is not a bypass of the rule in CLAUDE.md.
-- That gate exists because MunchStats indexes standard VGC events
-- alongside Champions ones, so a roster mart must filter by
-- event_format. Limitless is a Champions-only source -- every team_list
-- row is regulation_set 'm-a' -- and this mart's grain is
-- team_list_member, a different table with no event_format column to
-- filter on. Scoping is a property of the source here, not of a filter.
--
-- Coverage caveat, surfaced in the UI rather than only recorded here:
-- Limitless publishes the day-2 cut only, roughly 93 distinct Pokémon
-- across ~2,150 member rows against 203 in the full Champions roster. This
-- is a view of what converged at the top of the field, not of the meta.
