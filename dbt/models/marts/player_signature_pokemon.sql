-- Player-grain half of backlog.md #7 ("does this player have a signature
-- Pokémon," across their full history rather than the single-team grain
-- top_tournament_teams already reports): one row per player_id x
-- pokemon_key they've fielded, restricted to the current legal pool.
--
-- player_id is a deterministic hash of (player_name, player_country) --
-- see pipelines/extract/munchstats.py's _player_id -- so grouping by all
-- three together is safe: every row sharing a player_id shares the same
-- name/country. player_usage_share is this Pokémon's fraction of the
-- player's own total legal-pool roster appearances across every team of
-- theirs on record; player_pokemon_rank orders a player's own picks, so
-- rank 1 is their signature Pokémon. player_team_count (distinct teams
-- this player has fielded at all) is exposed alongside the rank as a
-- sample-size signal -- a "signature" claim from a player with only one
-- or two recorded teams is much weaker evidence than one from a player
-- with dozens.
