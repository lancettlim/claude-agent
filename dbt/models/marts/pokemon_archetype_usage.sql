-- Archetype Explorer member-level drill-down: joins the curated

-- each archetype's members are shown with actual tournament performance,
-- not just curated membership. usage_share/win_rate/record_count are
-- nullable -- a curated member may not have any recorded tournament
-- appearances yet, mirroring pokemon_champions_profile's nullable-usage
-- convention.
