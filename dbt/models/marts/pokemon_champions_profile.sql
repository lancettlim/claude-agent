-- Denormalized per-Pokémon profile for the dashboard's Speed Tiers, Team
-- Builder, Pokémon Profile, and Matchup views (docs/todo.md M6 backlog):
-- one row per currently legal Pokémon, combining its Champions-format base
-- stats (speed, for speed-tier ordering), its type_1/type_2 (for the
-- Profile type badge, type/role filters, and the Matchup tab's type
-- effectiveness and damage calculator), and its overall usage/win-rate
-- KPIs, so those views can list/sort/filter the legal pool without joining
-- multiple marts client-side. usage_count/usage_share/win_rate/
-- record_count are nullable — real MunchStats tournament data doesn't
-- cover every legal Pokémon, and a null here means "not yet seen in a
-- recorded roster", not zero.
--
-- max_investment_speed (backlog.md #16) is the Level-50 Speed stat under
-- the standard competitive "max speed investment" convention -- 252 EVs, a
-- beneficial nature, and a perfect (31) IV -- rather than the raw base
-- `speed` stat above, which is what a real team's Speed actually looks
-- like at the format's standard level and is what determines turn order
-- in practice. Exact EVs/nature per real roster entry would need Victory
-- Road's moveset data (backlog.md #25, still deferred); this is the
-- documented simplification that item calls out as the honest interim
-- convention. Formula (Bulbapedia's standard stat formula, Level 50, IV
-- 31, EV 252, nature 1.1x): floor((floor((2*base + 31 + floor(252/4)) *
-- 50/100) + 5) * 1.1), which simplifies exactly (2*base+94 is always
-- even) to floor((base_speed + 52) * 1.1) -- verified against a known
-- reference value: base speed 142 (Dragapult) -> 213.
