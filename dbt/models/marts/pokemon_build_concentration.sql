-- Item and build concentration metrics (backlog.md #14): a
-- Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (sum of squared shares) over
-- pokemon_item_usage.item_share and pokemon_ability_usage.ability_share
-- per Pokémon, distinguishing Pokémon with one locked-in optimal build
-- (HHI near 1: usage concentrated on a single item/ability) from ones with
-- genuinely contested choices (HHI near 0: usage spread evenly across
-- several). item_count/ability_count is how many distinct items/abilities
-- were observed at all, so a HHI of 1 with item_count 1 (no contested
-- choice observed) reads differently from a HHI of 1 with item_count > 1
-- (one build has crowded out real alternatives).
--
-- Built on top of pokemon_item_usage/pokemon_ability_usage rather than
-- re-deriving from tournament_team_member directly, so this mart always
-- agrees with the per-item/per-ability shares the Pokémon Profile tab
-- already shows.
