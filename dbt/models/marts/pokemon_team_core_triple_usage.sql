-- Champions-format three-Pokemon team cores. Each six-member team yields
-- C(6, 3) = 20 canonical triples; pokemon_key_a < pokemon_key_b <
-- pokemon_key_c makes the grain explicit and prevents mirrored duplicates.
--
-- triple_lift compares the observed share of teams containing all three
-- Pokemon with the share expected if their individual team appearances
-- were independent. avg_pair_lift/min_pair_lift keep the triple honest:
-- a high three-way score should not hide a constituent pair that never
-- forms a meaningful core. Counts and event/player coverage stay exposed
-- because all lift metrics are noisy at small samples.
