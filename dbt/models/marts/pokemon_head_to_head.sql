{{ config(location='../data/marts/pokemon_head_to_head.csv') }}
-- Real head-to-head records, built on tournament_match (backlog.md #27).
--
-- Grain and its honest limit: one row per (pokemon_key,
-- opponent_pokemon_key), counting matches where a team fielding the first
-- Pokémon faced a team fielding the second. RK9 publishes no per-battle log
-- naming which Pokémon were actually brought (VGC brings 4 of 6) or which
-- beat which, so this measures *team* outcomes attributed to every Pokémon
-- on the roster -- "teams with A beat teams with B this often", not "A
-- beats B". Every consumer of this mart must say so; see
-- dbt/models/marts/schema.yml.
--
-- Pairs are mirrored (A-vs-B and B-vs-A both present) so a lookup by
-- pokemon_key alone returns that Pokémon's full opponent list, matching
-- pokemon_team_core_usage's existing convention for partner pairs.
--
-- Scoped to Masters (the only division with rosters, see
-- assert_rk9_pairing_mapping_coverage.sql), to decided matches (a tie or
-- bye has no winner to attribute), and to the current legal pool.
--
-- wilson_lower_bound reuses pokemon_win_rate_summary.sql's 95% Wilson score
-- formula (backlog.md #13). It matters more here than there: head-to-head
-- counts are far smaller than aggregate ones, so a raw win_rate ranking is
-- dominated by 1-0 records without it.
