-- Tournament roster slots scoped to the Pokémon Champions format.
--
-- Every mart downstream of tournament rosters reads this rather than
-- tournament_team_member directly, because MunchStats indexes standard VGC
-- events (regulations F/H/I) alongside Champions ones and nothing used to
-- tell them apart -- so "Incineroar's usage" silently averaged two
-- different games with different legal pools and different mechanics.
-- Champions events are only 17.2% of staged roster slots, so this is not a
-- rounding error in the numbers it corrects.
--
-- The same conflation is what produced this repo's long-documented
-- "MunchStats nature coverage is only ~17%" note: that figure is the
-- Champions share of the corpus, not a coverage defect. Within Champions,
-- nature is reported for 100% of slots (and tera_type for 0%, since the
-- format has no Tera mechanic); outside it, exactly the reverse.
--
-- Joins team and event alongside the member row so downstream marts get
-- placement/record/tier/date without repeating the same two joins.
