"""Limitless VGC extraction.

Contract: data/staging/limitless.schema.json
Spec reference: docs/dataset-spec.md, "Source-specific extraction contracts > Limitless VGC"

docs/data-sources.md used to describe extracting this source by "browser
table extraction tool (e.g. Table Capture extension)" and screenshotting
tables. That is not necessary and never was: limitlessvgc.com is
server-rendered, and every page this extractor needs is a plain HTTP GET
with the data already in the markup, much of it on `data-` attributes:

  - `GET /tournaments?time=all` lists every tournament as a `<tr>` carrying
    data-date/data-country/data-name/data-format/data-players/data-winner
    plus a `/tournaments/<id>` link. `data-format` is the regulation set
    ("m-a"), so Champions events are identifiable without fetching them.
  - `GET /tournaments/<id>` is the standings table: one `<tr>` per player
    with data-rank/data-name/data-country, a `/players/<id>` link, and --
    for players whose list was published -- a `/teams/<id>` link.
  - `GET /teams/<id>` is the team list itself: six `div.pkmn[data-id]`
    blocks with item, ability, nature and moves.

Why this source, given MunchStats already covers the same events: what
Limitless has that MunchStats does not is **shared team identity**. A
`/teams/<id>` is a canonical team composition reused across players and
events -- team 6449 is credited to both a Regional winner and a 23rd-place
NAIC finish -- whereas MunchStats mints a fresh per-player team_id every
time. That makes `team_list` a real entity this dataset otherwise lacks,
and gives an independent second reading of the same rosters to
cross-validate against (see dbt/models/marts/roster_source_agreement.sql).

What this source is NOT for, despite docs/data-sources.md's original
framing: extending tournament history. Limitless does not reach further
back than MunchStats for this format -- only three Champions-format events
exist anywhere as of this writing, and both sources have all three. Its
other tournaments are standard VGC (regulations F/H/I), which is out of
scope per docs/prd.md. `format_filter` therefore defaults to Champions.

Team lists are fetched per distinct team id across the whole run, not per
player: the same team recurs across players and events, so deduplicating
first turns ~1,100 player rows per event into a few hundred fetches total.
Note `/tournaments/<id>/teams` renders many lists on one page, but only for
the day-2 cut (156 of 1,096 at NAIC), so it is not a substitute -- and it
omits the team ids that are this source's whole point.

Known risk, same posture as bulbagarden.py and rk9.py: Limitless'
rate-limiting/ToS stance for sustained scheduled access has not been
independently verified beyond confirming plain GETs work.
