"""MunchStats extraction.

Contract: data/staging/munchstats.schema.json
Spec reference: docs/dataset-spec.md, "Source-specific extraction contracts > MunchStats"

Pulls structured JSON from the MunchStats repo (github.com/PizzaTimeJoshua/munchstats)
via raw.githubusercontent.com and flattens nested team arrays into one row
per team member, per docs/data-sources.md's "How to extract" notes.

Repo layout (see the repo's README "Data Files" section):
  stats/tournaments/tournaments_index.json      one entry per scraped tournament
  stats/tournaments/{tournament_id}/metadata.json   event name/date/location/type
  stats/tournaments/{tournament_id}/players.json    list of {name, country,
      placement, team: [{pokemon, item, ability, tera_type, nature, moves}, ...],
      day_reached, team_link, record}

MunchStats doesn't expose an opaque per-player ID or a separately reported
form label (forms like "Urshifu-Rapid-Strike" are embedded in `pokemon`
name) — both are known risks called out in the schema contract. `player_id`
is derived from a hash of the player's name and country; `form_name` is
left blank pending normalization. `player_name` and `player_country` (a
two-letter code, e.g. "IT", "ES") are captured as their own columns
alongside `player_id` — real, sourced fields, not fabricated.

`metadata.json`'s `type` (tournament tier, e.g. "International"/"Regional"),
`players.json`'s `record` (win/loss count), and team-member `item`/
`ability`/`tera_type`/`nature`/`moves` are captured too, duplicated onto
every roster-slot row like `placement` already is; `moves` is a
pipe-delimited string since a roster slot can carry more than one.

Incremental extraction (backlog.md #44): a concluded tournament's
`players.json` (the bulk of every run's ~106k rows) never changes once
published, so re-downloading every tournament's full roster data on every
scheduled run is pure waste. `extract`'s `previous_snapshot_path` lets the
caller pass the most recent prior dated snapshot (see
`pipelines.cli._latest_snapshot_path`); for each tournament, the cheap
`metadata.json` is still always re-fetched (so a genuine change is never
missed), and the heavier `players.json` fetch is skipped in favor of the
cached rows only when that tournament's `(name, date, type)` signature is
unchanged from what's already cached -- mirroring
`pipelines/extract/bulbagarden.py`'s sha1-based `skip_existing` pattern
(fetch a cheap signal first, skip the expensive download only when it
still matches). Reused rows are still re-stamped with this run's
`extracted_at_utc`/`dataset_version`, the same "every row reflects this
extraction run" convention `bulbagarden.py`'s `extract()` already
establishes for its own skipped-download rows.

`tournaments_index.json` in production actually lists both Pokémon VGC
events and same-venue Pokémon TCG events side by side (discovered while
verifying this against the real live source, not anticipated up front) --
a TCG tournament's `players.json` reports players but every player's
`team` is empty, since TCG doesn't have a "Pokémon team" in this dataset's
sense, so it always contributes zero roster rows. Those TCG tournaments
can never satisfy the cache-hit check above (a zero-row tournament is
never actually written to the CSV, so it's never present in
`cached_rows_by_tournament` to compare against), which would otherwise
mean re-fetching their `players.json` on *every* run forever regardless of
caching. `metadata.json`'s own `teams_scraped` count avoids that
unconditionally, with no cache needed at all: `teams_scraped: 0` means
skip straight to an empty row list without ever fetching `players.json`,
on the very first extraction as much as the hundredth.
