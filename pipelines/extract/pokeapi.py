"""PokéAPI extraction.

Contract: data/staging/pokeapi.schema.json,
data/staging/pokeapi_move.schema.json,
data/staging/pokeapi_ability.schema.json,
data/staging/pokeapi_item.schema.json,
data/staging/pokeapi_artwork.schema.json
Spec reference: docs/dataset-spec.md, "Source-specific extraction contracts > PokéAPI"

Captures Pokémon/form identity rows and base stat rows, weekly refresh
cadence. Fetches every entry in PokéAPI's `/pokemon` list — base species
plus Mega/regional/alternate forms (e.g. `charizard-mega-x`,
`raichu-alola`) — not just the base national-dex range, so that
form-specific rows from OP.GG and MunchStats have a canonical row to join
against (dataset-spec.md's "Multi-form species that need explicit mapping
rather than name-only joins" known risk).

`pokemon_id` is the species' National Dex number, read from each form's
`species.url` rather than the form's own PokéAPI resource id — the latter
is an internal, non-dex id for alt forms (e.g. `charizard-mega-x` is
resource id 10034 but species id 6), and `pokemon_id` must stay the shared
identifier across all forms of one species. `form_name` is the form's own
PokéAPI slug (equal to the species name for the default/base form).
`type_1`/`type_2` (type_2 nullable) come off the same `/pokemon/{form}`
payload already fetched for stats, so adding them costs no extra HTTP call.

`extract_moves`/`extract_abilities`/`extract_items` are separate functions
writing separate staging files (move/ability/item grain, not
Pokémon/form grain) — added for the dashboard's Pokémon Profile
descriptions and Matchup-tab damage calculator (docs/todo.md M6 backlog:
"type-effectiveness / head-to-head matchups"). Each is scoped to an
explicit iterable of names (the moves/abilities/items actually reported in
MunchStats tournament roster data — `data/staging/munchstats.csv`'s
`moves`/`ability`/`item_name` fields) rather than PokéAPI's full
~900-move/~370-item catalog, since the dashboard only ever needs detail
for names that already appear in real tournament roster data.

`extract_artwork` is a fifth staging file at yet another grain: one
high-resolution PokéMon HOME render per form, downloaded from PokéAPI's
sprite *repository* rather than its JSON API. It exists because the
Bulbagarden menu sprites that back `pokemon_asset` today are 128x128 —
fine in a 40px table cell, blurry in the dashboard's 96px/128px hero
slots. Like the detail fetches it is scoped to an explicit iterable
(the forms that already have a Champions menu sprite) rather than
PokéAPI's full ~1,350-form list, and like `bulbagarden.py` it writes
binary image bytes alongside its CSV.
