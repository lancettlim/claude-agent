"""Shared HTTP retry/backoff helper for pipelines/extract/*.

Every extractor's raw HTTP calls (list/detail fetches, page scrapes, image
downloads) used to call `session.get(...).raise_for_status()` directly, so a
single transient failure -- a 5xx response, a dropped connection, a timeout
-- partway through a run aborted the whole extraction with no output at all.
That's expensive for PokéAPI's roughly 1,350 sequential requests per run in
particular. `get_with_retry` centralizes retry-with-exponential-backoff (the
pattern pokeapi.py's move/ability/item lookups already had one bespoke copy
of) so every extractor's request path gets it uniformly.
