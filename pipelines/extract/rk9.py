"""RK9.gg tournament pairings extraction.

Contract: data/staging/rk9_pairings.schema.json
Spec reference: docs/dataset-spec.md, "Source-specific extraction contracts > RK9.gg"

Supplies the match-level head-to-head data backlog.md #27 recorded as
having "no signal to derive from" -- MunchStats reports each team's
aggregate win/loss record but never who they played. RK9 is the tournament
software the events themselves run on (MunchStats scrapes it too, for
rosters), and it publishes round-by-round pairings:

  - `GET /pairings/{event_id}` returns the pairings shell. Its division tab
    strip (`<a id="P{pod}-tab" ...>Masters in Round 17</a>`) names every
    pod, its human division label, and the highest round reached.
  - `GET /pairings/{event_id}?pod={pod}&rnd={n}` returns one round's
    pairings as an HTML fragment (htmx lazy-loads these client-side; a
    plain GET works exactly as well, no browser automation needed).

Rounds are enumerated from the tab strip rather than from the fragments'
own `hx-get` attributes: the *currently active* round is rendered inline
into the shell instead of being lazy-loaded, so it has no `hx-get` of its
own and reading only those would silently drop the final round of every
event (verified against NAIC 2026, whose round 17 -- the finals -- appears
in no `hx-get`).

`event_id` needs no mapping seed or ID reconciliation: MunchStats scrapes
RK9 and reuses RK9's own event IDs verbatim, so the `event_id` already in
`tournament_event` (e.g. "NA02wgUPFDXKmQmqILwS") *is* the RK9 pairings key.
The event list therefore comes from MunchStats' tournaments_index.json --
the same document munchstats.py already reads -- rather than from a
separate RK9 crawl.

Scoped to Champions-format events (`format_filter`, default
gen9championsvgc2026regma). MunchStats indexes 60 events, most of them
standard VGC or same-venue TCG, which are out of this dataset's scope
(docs/prd.md) -- extracting all of them would mean ~1,300 requests per run
against a host whose posture is unverified (below) to produce rows nothing
downstream consumes.

Pairing rows are parsed by cell rather than by scraping the match container
loosely: every cell carries a fully-determined
`id="cell-{pod}-{round}-{index}-{slot}"`, where slot 1/2 are the two
players and slot 3 is the table number. A cell's class list carries the
result (`winner`/`loser`, plus `dropped` for a player who dropped out).
Outcome is derived structurally, so a shape this extractor has not seen
degrades honestly instead of being guessed at:

  - player 2's cell empty                -> "bye"
  - `winner` on player 1 / player 2      -> "player1_win" / "player2_win"
  - both cells present, neither a winner -> "tie"

Known risk, same posture as bulbagarden.py: RK9's rate-limiting/ToS stance
for sustained scheduled access has not been independently verified beyond
confirming that plain GETs work. Request volume is deliberately kept low --
one shell request plus one per (pod, round) for Champions events only, and
a concluded event's pairings are reused from the previous snapshot rather
than re-fetched (see `previous_snapshot_path`).
