"""Bulbagarden-sourced held-item icon resolution, with a PokéAPI fallback.

Like pipelines/render/assets.py's type/item icons, these are
rendering-support assets, not dataset entities — no provenance row, no
dataset_version, no release gate (see docs/dataset-spec.md's
"pokemon_asset" entity, the actual dataset entity for Pokémon sprites).

Bulbagarden Archives — the same MediaWiki wiki pipelines/extract/
bulbagarden.py sources Champions-menu species sprites from — also hosts
held-item sprite artwork, conventionally titled "File:Bag <Item Name>
Sprite.png" (e.g. "File:Bag Leftovers Sprite.png"). Unlike the species
sprite extractor, there's no single category listing every item to page
through ahead of time, so this resolves one item at a time: it queries
prop=imageinfo for a small set of guessed title variants (MediaWiki
accepts multiple `|`-joined titles per call, same batching technique
bulbagarden.py's _resolve_file_info uses) and takes the first one that
resolves to a real file.

Not every item's naming variant has been independently verified — callers
must fall back to pipelines.render.assets.ensure_item_icon (PokéAPI) on a
resolution miss (see pipelines/dashboard/build.py's _resolve_item_icons),
the same graceful-degradation convention every other icon/sprite helper in
this codebase follows.

Cached under a "bulbagarden_items/" subdirectory of cache_dir, distinct
from pipelines.render.assets.ensure_item_icon's "items/" subdirectory —
sharing one cache path between the two sources would let a PokéAPI
fallback silently poison the cache slot a later, successful Bulbagarden
lookup should have filled.
