"""backlog.md #46: pipelines/dashboard/static/*.js and the committed
docs/dashboard/*.js are supposed to be byte-identical copies (build.py's
`build()` copies the former into the latter), but nothing enforced that --
editing the wrong one silently produces a published site that disagrees
with its source. This guards against that drift directly, independent of
`build()`, so it also catches someone hand-editing the committed copy.
