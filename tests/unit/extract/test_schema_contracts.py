"""Backlog #41: every extractor's FIELDNAMES must match the field list its
data/staging/<subdir>.schema.json contract declares -- name-for-name, in
the same order -- so a code change that adds/renames/drops a staging
column can't drift silently out of sync with the documented contract.
This is the staging half of schema-drift enforcement; see
tests/unit/validate/test_report.py for the normalized-layer half (checked
against a real dbt build's CSV output, not just the extractor code)."""

# scheduled extraction populates, which is always as old as the last
# scheduled run. A PR that adds a source or a staging column therefore
# builds against snapshots that predate it. These cases must be
# *recognisable* so CI can skip with an explanation rather than red-fail on
# an opaque dbt error (see .github/workflows/ci.yml).
