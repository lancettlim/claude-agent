# TODO

Outstanding work for the v1 Pokémon Champions dataset artifact, derived from
`dataset-spec.md` and `prd.md`.

## Repository scaffolding

- [x] Create placeholder directories for staging, normalized, manifests,
  changelogs, and validation reports (`data/`, `releases/`, `reports/`)
- [x] Add a `manifest.json` starter template (`releases/manifests/manifest.template.json`)
- [x] Add a `CHANGELOG.md` starter template (`releases/changelogs/CHANGELOG.template.md`)
- [x] Add example/schema files for staging snapshots (`data/staging/*.schema.json`)
- [x] Add example/schema files for normalized tables (`data/normalized/*.schema.json`)
- [x] Add a validation report template (`reports/validation/validation_report.template.json`)

## Tooling

- [x] Add `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`-managed Python environment (pandas,
  requests, dbt-core, dbt-duckdb, pytest, ruff)
- [x] Add `pipelines/` package skeleton (`extract/` stubs per source,
  `validate/report.py`, `cli.py`)
- [x] Add `dbt/` project: staging sources, normalized models (see Phase 2),
  and singular tests encoding the coverage/null-rate/duplicate-key/
  referential-integrity gates from `dataset-spec.md`
- [x] Add `Makefile` with `setup`/`lint`/`test`/`dbt-build`/`validate`/`check`
  targets
- [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/loop.md` to reflect the build/test
  system
- [x] Add the Playwright dependency and browser-install step (`make setup`
  installs Chromium); implementing the OP.GG scraper itself is tracked
  under "Phase 1 — Ingestion" below

## Phase 1 — Ingestion

- [x] Implement extraction contract for PokéAPI (pokemon identity + base stats)
- [x] Implement extraction contract for OP.GG Pokémon Champions (legal pool +
  rebalanced stats)
- [x] Implement extraction contract for MunchStats (tournament/team/roster data)
- [x] Implement extraction contract for PokéBase (per-regulation legal-pool
  membership; pulled into v1 scope — see "V1 scope" in `dataset-spec.md` —
  once OP.GG proved insufficient for `legality_snapshot.regulation_code`)
- [x] Land staging outputs with raw snapshots and extraction metadata
- [x] Validate source availability and row-level parsing success thresholds
  (see `reports/validation/extraction_summary.json`: 100% request success
  and 0% required-field null rate across all four sources)
- [x] Extend MunchStats extraction (`pipelines/extract/munchstats.py`) to
  additionally capture `metadata.json`'s `type` field (tournament tier,
  e.g. "International"), `players.json`'s `record` field (win-rate proxy),
  and team-member `item`/`ability`/`tera_type`/`moves` fields — only
  `pokemon` is captured per slot today; update
  `data/staging/munchstats.schema.json` to match (see the gap noted in
  `dbt/models/marts/schema.yml`)
  (staging CSV now carries `event_tier`, `record_wins`/`record_losses`,
  `item_name`, `ability`, `tera_type`, and pipe-delimited `moves`; still
  raw/unmapped — Phase 2 normalizes these into the entity dictionary)

## Phase 2 — Normalization

- [x] Standardize IDs and join keys (`pokemon_key`, `pokemon_id`) across
  canonical, Champions, tournament, and legality data (`dbt/models/normalized/pokemon.sql`
  + `dbt/models/intermediate/`; PokéAPI extraction now covers Mega/regional/
  alternate forms too, and `dbt/seeds/*.csv` hold the controlled OP.GG-,
  MunchStats-, and PokéBase-name-to-PokéAPI-form mappings dataset-spec.md
  calls for)
- [x] Build `pokemon_stat_delta` (canonical vs Champions) outputs
- [x] Generate regulation-aware `legality_snapshot` outputs, sourced from
  PokéBase (`dbt/models/intermediate/int_pokebase_mapped.sql`) instead of
  OP.GG — OP.GG's Champions Pokédex page has only a single
  regulation-agnostic legal pool, so `regulation_code` was permanently
  null there; PokéBase publishes real per-Pokémon regulation-set
  membership (`m-a`/`m-b` as of this snapshot) and closes the gap. This
  table's null-rate gate now passes.
- [x] Normalize `tournament_event`, `tournament_team`, `tournament_team_member`
  (`dbt/models/intermediate/int_munchstats_deduped.sql` also resolves 9
  upstream MunchStats teams that were double-recorded under two placements)
- [x] Once the MunchStats extractor captures tier/record/item fields (see
  Phase 1), add them to `docs/dataset-spec.md`'s entity dictionary —
  `tournament_event` (tier), `tournament_team` (win-rate/`record`),
  `tournament_team_member` (`item`/`ability`/`tera_type`/`moves`) — and
  thread them through the corresponding `dbt/models/normalized/` models
  (new "Optional fields" bullets added to each entity, since MunchStats
  doesn't report tier/record/build for every event/player/slot; the three
  `dbt/tests/singular/assert_null_rate_*` gates were deliberately left
  untouched — they track only the pre-existing required-field lists)

## Phase 3 — Analytics and dashboard outputs

- [x] Publish flat analytical exports and summary aggregates
  (`dbt/models/marts/`: `pokemon_usage_summary`, `legality_summary_by_regulation`,
  `stat_change_leaderboard`, written to `data/marts/*.csv`)
- [x] Provide dashboard-ready trend tables (usage, legality, stat changes)
  (same three marts — `stat_change_leaderboard` currently shows every
  Pokémon as a "gainer" with delta 0, consistent with the zero-stat-delta
  snapshot noted in `releases/manifests/manifest-0.1.0.json`'s
  `known_limitations`, not a bug)
- [x] Document KPI views and filter dimensions (regulation/date/tournament tier)
  (`dbt/models/marts/schema.yml`): regulation and date are available now;
  tournament tier, win-rate proxies, and move/item drill-down (`docs/prd.md`'s
  fuller ambition) need MunchStats extraction fields not captured yet
  (`type`, `record`, `item`/`ability`/`moves` are in the raw source per
  `pipelines/extract/munchstats.py`'s docstring) — documented as a gap
  rather than faked
- [x] Once tier/record/item fields are normalized (see Phase 2), extend
  `dbt/models/marts/` and its `schema.yml` to support tournament-tier
  filtering, win-rate-proxy KPIs, and move/item drill-down, closing the
  gap this section's "Document KPI views and filter dimensions" item
  flagged
  (`pokemon_usage_summary` gained an `event_tier` dimension — one overall
  row per Pokémon plus one row per tier, each ranked within its own
  partition; new marts `pokemon_win_rate_summary` (record_wins/losses-based
  win rate), `pokemon_build_usage` (item x ability usage), and
  `pokemon_move_usage` (unnested move usage) cover the rest. Also fixed a
  pre-existing gap where `pipelines/cli.py`'s `extract` subcommand never
  registered the `pokebase` source, and updated `.gitignore`'s comment to
  match — both silently missed when PokéBase was added in an earlier pass.)

## Phase 4 — Visual assets and card rendering

- [x] Implement extraction contract for Bulbagarden Archives
  (`pipelines/extract/bulbagarden.py`: MediaWiki API pagination + batched
  imageinfo resolution + binary image download to a local gitignored cache,
  no HTML parser dependency needed — see its docstring)
- [x] Fetch the real Bulbagarden Champions-menu-sprites category inventory
  (359 titles) and build the `bulbagarden_title_to_pokeapi_form` mapping
  seed against live PokéAPI data (`dbt/seeds/bulbagarden_title_to_pokeapi_form.csv`
  + `dbt/seeds/schema.yml`); 358/359 titles resolved (one, Mega Meowstic,
  deliberately left unmapped rather than guessed, matching
  `opgg_key_to_pokeapi_form`'s precedent for the identical ambiguity)
- [x] Normalize into the new `pokemon_asset` entity
  (`dbt/models/staging/stg_bulbagarden.sql`,
  `dbt/models/intermediate/int_bulbagarden_mapped.sql` — including the
  cosmetic-duplicate dedup Vivillon/Florges/Furfrou/Alcremie/Pyroar need —
  `dbt/models/normalized/pokemon_asset.sql`); 317 final rows; all four
  release gates (duplicate-key, null-rate, referential-integrity, >=85%
  coverage) pass against real extracted data
- [x] Add PokéAPI-sprites-GitHub type/item icon fetch-on-demand helper
  (`pipelines/render/assets.py`) and a static move-name-to-type reference
  seed (`dbt/seeds/pokeapi_move_types.csv`, all 937 PokéAPI moves) for
  card rendering — neither is a dataset entity or release gate, both are
  rendering-support assets only
- [x] Build the team card renderer (`pipelines/render/`: `data_source.py`
  loads a `CardModel` from either real ingested `tournament_team`/
  `tournament_team_member` data by `team_id` or an ad-hoc JSON build spec;
  `template.py` renders Jinja2 HTML/CSS with base64-inlined sprite/icon
  images; `team_card.py` screenshots it to PNG via Playwright's headless
  Chromium) and a `render-card` CLI subcommand
  (`--team-id <id>` or `--spec <path.json>`, `--output <path.png>`)
- [x] Wire real Bulbagarden sprite art into the renderer end-to-end for a
  team_id pulled from real MunchStats data (ran all five extractors +
  `make dbt-build` for real, then `render-card --team-id
  011yDp6gkk3AeXY6wFCm` — confirmed real sprite art, not placeholder, for
  all 6 roster slots: Sneasler, Kingambit, Aerodactyl, Basculegion,
  Sylveon, Alolan Ninetales)
- [x] Extend `pipelines/release/build.py` to copy `pokemon_asset`-
  referenced images into `releases/data/<version>/images/` and add the
  Bulbagarden source + `pokemon_asset` table + images block to the
  manifest/changelog templates, plus a redistribution-posture disclaimer
  (Bulbagarden-sourced artwork is ultimately Nintendo/Game Freak-owned;
  see `docs/dataset-spec.md`'s "Image asset source" section — the copy
  step, manifest/changelog templates, and `releases/data/README.md`
  disclaimer were already in place; fixed a real gap where a missing
  cached image would crash the release with `FileNotFoundError` instead of
  skipping it gracefully — coverage gate is only >=85%, not 100% —  and
  cut `dataset_version 0.2.0`, the first release with real Bulbagarden
  data: 317 images copied, 0 missing, `pokemon_asset` at 317 rows)

## M6 — Dashboard analytics release

The two unchecked `Backlog:` items below (originally three; #30 and #34
have since shipped, see their entries above) mirror `docs/backlog.md`'s
#18-#20/#29-#30 trend-chart work and #31's Streamlit dashboard. Both were
**archived** on 2026-08-02 — excluded from active scope by explicit user
decision, alongside `backlog.md`'s meta-shift/legal-pool/stat-change trend
items — so they stay unchecked but are no longer active work; see
`backlog.md`'s "Archived" notes on those numbered entries for the shared
rationale. They stay here as the committed record either way; `backlog.md`
holds everything not yet committed to.

- [x] Stand up a first-party analytics dashboard (KPI overview cards;
  trend views by regulation window and tournament period; drill-down by
  Pokémon, team core, move, and item) on top of `data/marts/*.csv`, per
  `docs/prd.md`'s M6 milestone and "Dashboard analytics module"
  requirement (`pipelines/dashboard/`: KPI cards, usage-by-tier/
  win-rate/build/move drill-downs are functional today against real data)
- [x] Decide and document the dashboard's tech stack and hosting approach
  (resolved in `docs/prd.md`'s Open questions and `docs/dashboard.md`: a
  static HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS site, Chart.js via CDN, no backend, deployed
  via GitHub Pages serving `/docs`)
- [x] Remove the stat-change leaderboard and legal-pool trend-by-regulation
  sections: both were structurally built but permanently showed a
  "not enough data yet" empty state (zero nonzero stat deltas, only one
  `snapshot_date`), so they were cut from `index.html.jinja`/`app.js`
  rather than ship two always-empty sections — see `docs/dashboard.md`'s
  "Removed sections" note; re-add once a rebalance + multiple snapshots
  make the underlying data real
- [x] Dashboard full redesign (live at
  https://lancettlim.github.io/pokemon-agent/dashboard/): tabbed navigation
  (Overview/Usage/Builds/Moves/Team Cores) replacing the single scrolling
  page; Pokémon sprites, move-type icons, and item icons throughout (KPI
  cards, tables, chart axes, chart tooltips — see `docs/dashboard.md`'s
  "Icon sources"); mobile-responsive layout for the KPI grid, tab nav, and
  tables (breakpoints at 720px/480px, horizontal table scroll); and a new
  `pokemon_team_core_usage` mart + Team Cores drill-down tab, closing the
  "team core" gap named in `docs/prd.md`'s original scope ("Drill-down by
  Pokémon, team core, move, and item usage") but never built until now.
  The stat-change leaderboard and legal-pool-trend sections stay removed
  (still genuinely data-starved, see above) and were not part of this pass.
- [x] Write a UX design system for the dashboard
  (`docs/design-system.md`: design tokens, component catalog, Pokémon-
  representation and naming conventions, ordering conventions) and apply
  it: PascalCase Pokémon display names derived from `pokemon_key`/
  `form_name` instead of the species-only `pokemon_name` column (fixes a
  real bug where alternate forms of one species, e.g. Landorus-Incarnate
  vs. Landorus-Therian, displayed identically —
  `pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s `to_pascal_case()`, revised from an
  initial camelCase pass); usage-percentage
  (`pokemon_usage_summary.usage_share`) surfaced on the "Most Used" KPI
  card and a new Usage leaders table; explicit descending order-by-usage/
  order-by-win-rate on every Pokémon leaderboard/picker (see
  `docs/design-system.md`'s "Ordering convention"); a new **Speed Tiers**
  tab (bar chart + full table, bucketed into Blazing/Fast/Average/Slow
  badges) built on a new `pokemon_champions_profile` mart (one row per
  legal Pokémon: Champions-format base stats + usage/win-rate); and a new
  **Team Builder** tab (fully client-side, `localStorage`-persisted,
  no backend) for assembling a roster of up to 6 from the legal pool,
  sortable by usage/win-rate/speed, with a speed-order readout reusing
  the Speed Tiers badge scale. Rank badges added to the Usage and Win-rate
  leaders tables for a consistent leaderboard pattern across tabs.
- [x] Backlog: type-effectiveness / head-to-head matchups — **partially
  resolved** by the competitive-UX redesign pass below (new **Matchup**
  tab: type effectiveness + a stats/setup/weather damage calculator, using
  new `pokemon.type_1`/`type_2` and `move_detail` data from PokéAPI). Still
  not buildable: real head-to-head battle-outcome data — MunchStats
  reports team-level win/loss records, not individual battle outcomes
  against a named opponent, so "what beats Pokémon X in practice" has no
  real signal; the Matchup tab's co-usage panel is an explicitly-labeled
  teammate-pairing proxy, not that signal. Closing this for real needs a
  battle-log source not currently in scope or deferred (see
  `docs/design-system.md`'s "Backlog: not yet buildable").
- [x] Broadcast/esports dashboard redesign + feature expansion: full
  visual re-theme (`docs/design-system.md`'s broadcast color-block header,
  `--accent-red`/`--accent-gold` tokens, three-step `--icon-sm/md/lg`
  scale replacing four ad-hoc pixel sizes); removed Chart.js/CDN entirely
  in favor of a dependency-free ranked-list component
  (`renderRankedList()`); merged the Builds/Moves/Team Cores tabs into one
  **Pokémon Profile** tab with a single relevance-sorted picker; Pokémon
  `<select>` dropdowns now sorted by `usage_share` descending instead of
  alphabetically (superseding the prior "dropdowns stay alphabetical"
  convention); sortable `<th>` columns on every leaderboard table
  (resolves the "sortable table columns" backlog item below); new
  **Archetypes** tab (Archetype Explorer) backed by a curated,
  editorial-not-sourced `dbt/seeds/archetype_pokemon_map.csv` seed plus two
  new marts (`pokemon_archetype_usage`, `archetype_summary`); new
  **Regulations** tab (Regulation Comparison) backed by a new
  `cumulative_legal_pokemon_count` column on `legality_summary_by_
  regulation` (naive union across regulations, with the PokéBase
  no-removal-signal caveat shown as visible UI copy — resolves the
  "regulation-code filter" half of the backlog item below); new
  `build_share`/`move_share`/`partner_share` percentage columns on
  `pokemon_build_usage`/`pokemon_move_usage`/`pokemon_team_core_usage` so
  raw counts could be dropped from every view in favor of percentages (a
  small `(n=X)` annotation stays next to win rate specifically, so a
  100%-on-n=1 doesn't read as more authoritative than a well-established
  Pokémon's real win rate); Overview redesigned into a "Top 12" spotlight
  grid + "Top 30" ranked list; a minimum-recorded-matches filter on Win
  rate leaders; `player_name`/`player_country` (real MunchStats fields
  that were previously discarded during extraction, only hashed into an
  opaque `player_id`) now flow through to `tournament_team` and into
  `pipelines/render/`'s `CardModel`; the team-card renderer re-themed to
  match the dashboard's broadcast palette with a player/country banner
  row; and a new **Pro Team Gallery** (curated real teams, pre-rendered
  via `render-card` and committed to `data/reference_teams/`, shown in the
  Team Builder tab with a "Load into my builder" button) — see
  `docs/dashboard.md`'s "Pro Team Gallery", "Cumulative legal pool", and
  "Archetype Explorer" sections.
- [x] Competitive-UX dashboard redesign pass: new PokéAPI extraction
  (`pokemon.type_1`/`type_2`; new `move_detail`/`ability_detail`/
  `item_detail` reference tables, scoped to names seen in real tournament
  rosters) closing the type/move-detail half of the matchup backlog item
  above; new `top_tournament_teams` mart (real MunchStats team leaderboard
  by win_rate); removed the **Archetypes** and **Regulations** tabs
  (`legality_summary_by_regulation` still feeds the page-level Legal Pool
  KPI card, just has no dedicated tab); removed Overview's Top 30 ranked
  list (Top 12 grid only — the Usage tab is the full leaderboard now);
  replaced the ranked-list bar component with a dashboard-wide `.grid-6xn`
  6-column grid (`renderGrid6xn()`) used for every usage/win-rate metric,
  with bolded headline percentages; split the old combined
  `pokemon_build_usage` mart into `pokemon_item_usage`/
  `pokemon_ability_usage`, and gave the Pokémon Profile tab three separate
  Items(top 5)/Ability(top 5)/Moves(top 15) `.grid-6xn` sections instead of
  one combined table, each showing a PokéAPI `short_effect` description; a
  larger `--icon-xl` dual-type badge on the Profile header; new type/role/
  stat-range/usage-range filters (Usage, Speed Tiers, Team Builder); new
  **Matchup** tab (type effectiveness, teammate co-usage, and a damage
  calculator — core mechanics plus a curated item/ability toggle list,
  documented scope in `docs/design-system.md`); new **Top Teams** tab
  (real `top_tournament_teams` leaderboard, the Pro Team Gallery moved
  here from Team Builder, and a pokepast.es-style Showdown-text paste-in/
  out importer/exporter); Team Builder slots now show stats/top-ability/
  top-4-moves per pick, plus an "Export as pokepaste text" button. See
  `docs/design-system.md` for the full component/token reference.
- [x] **Mart-wiring pass (2026-08-03)**: wire every analytics mart the
  backlog had shipped-but-left-unsurfaced into the dashboard.
  `pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s `MART_FIELDS` listed 11 marts while
  `dbt build` produced 23, so eight real, tested, non-degenerate marts
  were readable only through `docs/local-queries.md`. All eight are now
  wired: **Usage** gained a regulation filter (`pokemon_usage_by_
  regulation`, #12) and a **Success** subtab (`pokemon_placement_weighted_
  usage`, #8) with a rank-movement badge; **Pokémon Profile** gained
  build-concentration badges (`pokemon_build_concentration`, #14) and a
  co-occurrence/synergy-lift toggle on Team Cores (`pokemon_team_synergy`,
  #9); **Speed Tiers** now reads `pokemon_speed_tiers` (#16) with a
  scenario selector (base / max investment / ×1.5 / ×2 / ×3) and an
  "Outruns" benchmark, replacing the flat base-speed view; **Matchup**
  gained a per-side Matchup-profile panel (`pokemon_matchup_summary`); and
  a new **Players & Regions** tab surfaces both halves of #7
  (`pokemon_usage_by_country`, `player_signature_pokemon`).
  `stat_change_leaderboard` (#17), the archetype marts, and
  `roster_source_agreement` stay deliberately unwired — see
  `docs/dashboard.md`'s "Marts wired in the mart-wiring pass" for why, plus
  the payload-slicing rationale for the two large marts. Verified against a
  real `extract all` + `dbt build` + `build-dashboard` run, driven in
  Chromium with zero console errors — which caught two real data-shape
  problems that the mart columns alone would have shipped as misleading
  views: a "signature Pokémon" share is structurally capped at 16.7% (a
  Pokémon appears at most once on a six-slot team), so the specialists
  table ranks on share of the player's *teams* instead; and only three
  Champions events exist at all, so a `>= 3` recorded-teams floor left the
  By-player view showing exactly one player (2,329 players have one team,
  358 have two, one has three) — the floor is 2. Both are documented in
  `docs/dashboard.md`.
- [ ] ARCHIVED (excluded from active scope, 2026-08-02): further dashboard
  capability items not covered by the above redesigns: a tournament-event/
  date filter once multiple snapshots exist (still blocked — only one
  `snapshot_date` in the data; the event-date variant shipped separately,
  see the Usage-tab Trends subtab item above), and trend/line charts once
  that same multi-snapshot data exists. Note the event-date-filter part of
  this specific bullet is now stale on top of being archived — #30 already
  shipped a tournament-*date* filter over `pokemon_usage_by_event_date`;
  what's left here is only the snapshot-date variant, i.e. `backlog.md`'s
  #18-#20.
- [ ] ARCHIVED (excluded from active scope, 2026-08-02): build a dynamic
  Python/Streamlit dashboard on top of `pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s
  existing mart-loading/KPI logic, once the dataset has enough snapshots/
  trend data (multiple `snapshot_date`s, a real Champions rebalance) to
  justify the added hosting complexity beyond today's free static GitHub
  Pages site — not part of this pass's scope (`backlog.md` #31)

## Foundational enablers (backlog Section 0)

The five items below are mirrored in `docs/backlog.md`'s "Section 0 — Foundational
enablers" (items #1-#5); restating them here per `.claude/loop.md`'s backlog-grooming
loop. Item #1 was the highest-leverage: it unblocked eight other backlog entries.
All five are now shipped.

- [x] Backlog: Append-only staging snapshot history — `pipelines/cli.py`'s
  `extract` subcommand now writes each run to a date-partitioned
  `data/staging/<source>/<date>.csv` (one file per UTC day) instead of the
  extractors overwriting a single file; the extractors themselves (`extract()`
  in each `pipelines/extract/*.py` module) were left untouched since they
  already just write to whatever `output_path` they're given — the
  partitioning lives in the caller. Pruned per source after every write via
  `_RETENTION_COUNTS` (12 weekly PokéAPI snapshots, 14 daily OP.GG/PokéBase,
  7 daily MunchStats given its ~37MB/run size, 10 on-demand Bulbagarden).
  Format stays CSV, not Parquet — matches the existing
  `data/staging/*.schema.json` contracts and needs no new dependency.
  `dbt/models/staging/_sources.yml`'s `external_location` now globs each
  source's directory. `.gitignore` updated to match (`docs/backlog.md` #1)
- [x] Backlog: Snapshot-aware dbt layer — every `dbt/models/staging/stg_*.sql`
  now unions all retained snapshots with a `cast(extracted_at_utc as date) as
  snapshot_date` column (matching `legality_snapshot`'s existing convention),
  making the full extraction history queryable directly from staging. A new
  `dbt/models/intermediate/int_*_latest.sql` selector per source (8 total)
  filters back down to the current point-in-time snapshot; the models that
  used to reference `stg_*` directly (`pokemon`, `pokemon_stat_canonical`,
  `move_detail`, `ability_detail`, `item_detail`, and the four `int_*_mapped`
  models) now reference the corresponding `int_*_latest` model instead — a
  parallel history layer alongside the normalized entities, per the lower-
  disruption option `docs/backlog.md` #2 itself suggested, rather than making
  the normalized layer snapshot-scoped. Verified end-to-end against a
  synthetic two-snapshot PokéAPI fixture (older snapshot with a deliberately
  wrong stat value, newer with the real one): `stg_pokeapi` correctly showed
  both dates, `int_pokeapi_latest` correctly kept only the newer one, and
  `pokemon_stat_canonical.csv` was unaffected — one row per Pokémon, no new
  columns leaked into the normalized CSV output (`docs/backlog.md` #2)
- [x] Backlog: Scheduled refresh automation — new
  `.github/workflows/scheduled-extraction.yml`: daily cron for OP.GG/
  MunchStats/PokéBase, weekly cron for PokéAPI, `workflow_dispatch` for
  ad-hoc runs, Bulbagarden left on-demand-only per its unverified rate-limit
  posture. Since `data/staging/` is intentionally gitignored (see item #1),
  runner-to-runner persistence goes through `actions/cache` (unique key per
  run plus a `restore-keys` prefix fallback, since a cache entry is immutable
  once created) rather than committing snapshots to the repo (`docs/backlog.md` #3)
- [x] Backlog: Plumb `dataset_version` through extraction — new
  `pipelines/versioning.py`'s `latest_published_version()` reads the highest
  version under `releases/manifests/manifest-*.json`; `extract`'s new
  `--dataset-version` flag defaults to it (a routine refresh is staged toward
  a patch bump of the currently-published version unless told otherwise) and
  is threaded through to every extractor call. `pipelines/validate/report.py`'s
  `generate()` uses the same default instead of a hardcoded `"0.1.0"`
  (`docs/backlog.md` #4)
- [x] Backlog: Orchestration entry point — `extract` gained an `all` source
  choice that runs every extractor in dependency order (munchstats before
  pokeapi, so pokeapi's move/ability/item detail fetch has roster names to
  scope to); new Makefile targets `extract-all`, `refresh` (`extract-all` →
  `dbt-build` → `validate`), and `release` (`refresh` → `pipelines.cli
  release`, gated on an explicit `VERSION=X.Y.Z` since picking the next
  dataset version is a human call), chained the same way `dashboard` already
  chains `dbt-build` → `build-dashboard` (`docs/backlog.md` #5)

## Platform hardening (backlog Section 3)

- [x] Backlog #36: Fix vacuously-passing coverage tests — the four
  `dbt/tests/singular/assert_*_coverage.sql` gates (OP.GG legal pool,
  PokéBase legal pool, Bulbagarden sprite, tournament-team-member mapping)
  each had a `when total_count = 0 then 10000` branch that reported 100%
  coverage whenever their source had zero rows, so a total upstream outage
  yielding an empty staging CSV passed every gate and could be released.
  Changed each to report `0` (not `10000`) in that branch instead, so an
  empty source now fails its coverage gate. Confirmed the zero-row branch
  can only be reached by a genuinely empty (but present) snapshot file, not
  a missing one — DuckDB's external-source glob (`_sources.yml`'s
  `external_location`) raises an `IO Error` before the query ever runs if
  no file matches the pattern, verified directly against `duckdb.connect()`
  with a nonexistent vs. an empty (header-only) CSV.
- [x] Backlog #38: Don't swallow the `dbt build` return code —
  `pipelines/cli.py`'s `_run_validate` now captures `dbt build`'s exit code
  instead of discarding it, and treats an exit code outside `{0, 1}` as an
  unexpected crash (returned directly, without generating a report). Even
  for the expected `0`/`1` range, it no longer assumes a `1` means "tests
  ran and some failed" — it now checks that `dbt/target/run_results.json`
  was actually rewritten during this invocation (mtime at or after the
  subprocess call started) before reshaping it into a report, so a compile
  or connection error that exits non-zero without producing fresh results
  is refused rather than silently reshaping a stale prior run's artifacts
  into a false pass. Also switched the subprocess call from bare `dbt` to
  `uv run dbt` to match the Makefile's invocation, and dropped a no-op list
  copy (`[f for f in ...]` -> the list itself). New tests in
  `tests/unit/test_cli.py` cover the clean-pass, gate-failure,
  unexpected-crash-code, and stale-run_results cases.
- [x] Backlog #35: CI workflow — new `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered
  on every PR and push to `main`. `lint`/`test` always run (offline, no
  network dependency). `dbt-build`/`validate` restore the same
  `actions/cache` entry `scheduled-extraction.yml` already populates
  (read-only, via `actions/cache/restore`, so CI never re-extracts or hits
  any external source itself) and run against that; degrades to a skipped
  no-op on a fresh fork with no scheduled run yet, rather than failing.
  Caught firsthand: PR #40 (backlog #8/#10/#12/#13/#14) had zero CI checks
  run against it before this existed.
- [x] Backlog #32: JSON feed alongside the baked-in dashboard data —
  `pipelines/dashboard/build.py`'s `build()` now also writes `data.json`
  (the same payload) alongside `index.html`, which stays the inline-data
  version so it keeps working opened directly via `file://`.
- [x] Backlog #46: Dashboard JS duplication check — new
  `tests/unit/dashboard/test_static_duplication.py`, comparing
  `pipelines/dashboard/static/{app,matchup,teams}.js` directly against
  their committed `docs/dashboard/` copies. Its first run **failed for
  real**: `app.js` had moved on through two more commits (sub-tabs,
  icon-only type badges, a sortable moves table) past the last time
  `docs/dashboard/app.js` was actually republished, so the live GitHub
  Pages dashboard was missing real, already-built UI features. Fixed by
  rerunning `make dashboard` and committing the regenerated
  `docs/dashboard/`.
- [x] Backlog #37: Derive the validation report from dbt's manifest —
  `pipelines/validate/report.py` used to map tests to report sections via
  four hardcoded dicts; five real singular tests (`ability_detail`,
  `item_detail`, `move_detail`'s duplicate-key tests, plus
  `archetype_pokemon_map`'s duplicate-key and referential-integrity tests)
  ran on every build but appeared in no report section, so they could
  never block a release. Every singular test now declares its own
  `{{ config(meta={category: ..., ...}) }}`, and `build_report` buckets by
  `meta.category` instead of a name lookup; an uncategorized test lands in
  a new `uncategorized_checks` section (still gate-eligible) instead of
  vanishing. Verified against a real `extract all` + `dbt build`: all 13
  duplicate-key tables and 9 referential-integrity checks now appear with
  real status.
- [x] Backlog #39: Source freshness gate — `dbt/models/staging/_sources.yml`'s
  seven scheduled sources gained `freshness:`/`loaded_at_field` config
  (thresholds mirroring `docs/dataset-spec.md`'s weekly/daily cadences);
  `pipelines/cli.py`'s `_run_validate` now also runs `dbt source
  freshness`, and `report.py`'s new `build_freshness_checks` folds a stale
  ("error") source into `release_blocking_findings` the same as any other
  failing gate. Verified against a real `extract all` run: all seven
  sources report `pass` with real age data.
- [x] Backlog #47: `sprites.py` rebuild ordering constraint —
  `copy_sprites` used to `rmtree` the whole `images/` output directory,
  which would wipe out `images/icons/`/`images/reference_teams/` if it
  ever ran after those `build.py` steps instead of before (today's order
  happened to be safe, nothing enforced it). It now only unlinks the
  top-level `*.png` files it owns, leaving sibling subdirectories alone
  regardless of call order. New regression test confirms a pre-populated
  icons subdirectory survives a `copy_sprites` call.
- [x] Backlog #40: Row-count anomaly detection — new dbt *generic* test
  (this project's first — see backlog #42's own "not a single generic
  test" observation), `dbt/macros/test_row_count_anomaly.sql`, applied to
  each of the seven scheduled sources in `_sources.yml`'s `data_tests:`.
  Compares the latest `snapshot_date`'s row count against the immediately
  preceding one and fails below 50% of that baseline — the volume-drop
  case (e.g. 106,000 rows to 500) that #36's zero-row gate can't see.
  Fewer than two snapshots passes rather than failing vacuously, since
  there's no baseline yet, not an outage. Wired into
  `pipelines/validate/report.py` as a new `row_count_anomaly_checks`
  category via the same `meta.category` mechanism #37 introduced. Verified
  against a synthetic two-snapshot fixture: a 300→50 drop fails at
  1667bps, a 300→280 fluctuation passes, and a single-snapshot source
  passes.
- [x] Backlog #43: Extractor resilience (retry/backoff) — new shared
  `pipelines/extract/http.py`'s `get_with_retry`: retries a transient
  failure (connection error, timeout, 5xx response) up to three times with
  exponential backoff, failing immediately on a 4xx. Applied to every raw
  HTTP call across all five extractors, including the two paths that had
  none before — `pokeapi.py`'s `_fetch_pokemon_list`/`_fetch_pokemon` (the
  ~1,350-sequential-request path this item names directly) and
  `opgg.py`/`pokebase.py`/`munchstats.py`/`bulbagarden.py`'s page/JSON/
  image fetches. `pokeapi.py`'s move/ability/item lookups already had a
  bespoke retry loop from an earlier pass; that's now deleted in favor of
  the shared helper. Rate limiting (throttling request cadence, not just
  reacting to failures) is the one part of this item's value statement
  still open — a smaller, separate follow-up.
- [x] Backlog #49: Fix bps-based validation-report metrics reading as 0 on
  a passing check — dbt-core's `TestRunner.build_test_run_result`
  (`dbt/task/test.py`) hardcodes `failures = 0` on a passing test, so every
  coverage/null-rate/row-count-anomaly check's `metric_value` in
  `validation_report.json` read `0.0` whenever the check actually passed
  (status was still correct; only the reported number was wrong).
  `pipelines/validate/report.py`'s new `_recompute_bps_ratio` re-executes
  each check's own `compiled_code` (already present per-result in
  `run_results.json`) against the built `dbt/data/warehouse.duckdb`,
  wrapped in the same `fail_calc` expression the manifest already
  declares, recovering the true ratio regardless of pass/fail; falls back
  to the old (fail-path-only-correct) behavior if the warehouse or
  compiled_code isn't available. Needed a `chdir` into `dbt/` for the
  recompute query, since a `source()` reference compiles to a literal
  relative CSV glob path resolved against dbt's own working directory, not
  the repo root — confirmed by testing the naive approach directly:  it
  silently read zero rows instead of erroring. Verified against a real
  `extract all` + `dbt build` + `validate` run: `opgg_legal_pool_coverage`
  now reports `0.9842` (previously `0.0`), matching the real figure
  already documented elsewhere in this repo. `duckdb` is now an explicit
  `pyproject.toml` dependency (`report.py` imports it directly).
- [x] Backlog #44: Incremental extraction — `pipelines/extract/
  munchstats.py`'s `extract` gained a `previous_snapshot_path` parameter
  (wired up munchstats-only in `pipelines/cli.py`'s `_run_extract`, via the
  already-existing `_latest_snapshot_path` helper): each tournament's cheap
  `metadata.json` is still always re-fetched, but the heavy `players.json`
  fetch (the bulk of every run's ~106k rows) is skipped in favor of cached
  rows whenever that tournament's `(name, date, type)` signature is
  unchanged — the same "cheap signal first, skip the expensive download
  only if it still matches" pattern `bulbagarden.py`'s sha1-based
  `skip_existing` already established. Verified against real data:
  re-running `extract munchstats` same-day reproduced the identical
  106,134 rows in 11 seconds, down from the original run's 63 live
  requests fetching ~37MB. (A real request-count gap this content-only
  verification couldn't see — live MunchStats indexes same-venue TCG
  events alongside VGC ones, which this caching couldn't recognize as
  cacheable since they never produce output rows to cache — was caught
  and fixed under backlog #48 below, once real per-request counting
  existed to reveal it.)
- [x] Backlog #48: Extraction run metadata and structured logging —
  `pipelines/extract/http.py` gained `RequestStats`/`track_requests()`
  (instrumenting the one `get_with_retry` chokepoint every extractor's raw
  HTTP calls already share, rather than touching each extractor module);
  new `pipelines/extract/summary.py` computes real `rows_written`/
  `required_field_null_rate` per source and merges just that source's
  entry into `reports/validation/extraction_summary.json` (previously a
  hand-written file dated 2026-07-19 that no code generated or updated).
  `pipelines/cli.py`'s new `_run_tracked_extract` wraps every extraction
  in this tracking and now catches an extractor exception, prints a
  structured one-line error, and returns a controlled exit code instead of
  an unhandled traceback — matching `_run_validate`'s existing catch-log-
  return convention. PokéAPI's move/ability/item detail fetches each get
  their own entry now instead of vanishing into one merged "PokéAPI" row.
  Verified against real, freshly-run extractions: this is exactly what
  caught the real #44 gap described above (MunchStats' `requests_attempted`
  came back as 90, not ~32, revealing live TCG-tournament entries #44's
  caching couldn't recognize) — after that fix, a real re-run confirmed
  the true minimum, 61 requests, with the same 106,134 rows preserved.
- [x] Backlog #41: Schema-drift enforcement — new `pipelines/
  schema_contracts.py` loads a `*.schema.json` contract's declared field
  names; new `tests/unit/extract/test_schema_contracts.py` asserts every
  extractor's `FIELDNAMES` matches its `data/staging/*.schema.json`
  contract (pure code-level, runs on every push); new
  `pipelines/validate/report.py`'s `build_schema_drift_checks` compares
  each real `data/normalized/<entity>.csv` header against its
  `data/normalized/<entity>.schema.json` contract, wired into
  `release_blocking_findings` like any other gate (a missing CSV reports
  `skipped`, not `fail`). Verified against a real `extract` + `dbt build`
  + `validate` run: all 11 present normalized entities pass,
  `pokemon_asset` correctly skips (Bulbagarden wasn't extracted this
  pass).
- [x] Backlog #42: Mart tests — every one of the 21 marts now carries
  `not_null` on its grain column(s) plus a uniqueness check (dbt's
  built-in `unique` for 8 single-column-grain marts, a new generic test
  `dbt/macros/test_unique_combination_of_columns.sql` for the 13
  composite-grain marts — this project's second generic test after
  backlog #40's `row_count_anomaly`). Tagged `meta.category: mart_quality`
  and wired into `report.py` as a new `mart_quality_checks` section,
  deliberately excluded from `release_blocking_findings` since marts
  aren't part of the release package. Caught a real bug while verifying:
  a `unique_combination_of_columns` test was the first query to ever read
  `player_signature_pokemon.csv`'s full row width back into DuckDB, and
  `read_csv`'s auto-detect sniffer (only samples ~20,480 rows) mis-guessed
  the CSV dialect because the first quoted comma in a player name didn't
  appear until row 34,569. Fixed at the source — `dbt_project.yml`'s
  `marts`/`normalized` configs now pin `csv_read_options: {quote: '"',
  escape: '"'}` — rather than working around it in the test, since the
  same latent risk existed for the normalized layer too. Verified against
  real data: a clean `dbt build` (147 pass) and `pipelines.cli validate`
  (54 mart_quality_checks, all pass).
- [x] Backlog #15 (softer step): Archetype seed drift-flagging test — new
  `dbt/tests/singular/assert_archetype_pokemon_map_intra_group_synergy.sql`
  flags (via `severity=warn`, a new non-blocking `archetype_drift`
  `meta.category`) archetypes in the curated `archetype_pokemon_map` seed
  whose members don't show above-chance real team synergy with each other
  (backlog #9's `pokemon_team_synergy.lift`). Verified against real data:
  found genuine drift in 3 of 6 current archetypes — `rain`
  (pelipper/politoed) has zero recorded teams ever fielding both, `sun`
  and `tailwind-hyper-offense` both average well below-chance lift across
  their curated pairs — while correctly leaving `sand` (one genuinely
  strong pair) and the two single-member archetypes unflagged. Full
  data-derived clustering (replacing the curated seed) is still open;
  this only adds a signal for when it disagrees with real data.

## Consumption surfaces (backlog Section 2)

- [x] Backlog #28: Local query and notebook quickstart — new
  `docs/local-queries.md`: how to open `dbt/data/warehouse.duckdb`
  directly (DuckDB CLI or Python) and seven starter queries, each verified
  against a real, freshly-extracted snapshot. Several of the queries
  (team synergy lift, placement-weighted usage, build concentration)
  surface marts not yet wired into the dashboard UI at
  all, so this doc is currently the only way to see their output.
- [x] Backlog #34: Pokémon Profile empty state — decided to keep the
  current default-to-highest-usage behavior rather than build an empty
  state, matching every other tab's "show ranked content immediately"
  convention. Documented in `docs/design-system.md`'s new "Default
  selection, not an empty state (Pokémon Profile)" subsection.
- [x] Backlog #33: GitHub Releases with packaged artifacts — new
  `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml`, triggered by the commit that
  adds a new `releases/manifests/manifest-<version>.json` to `main` (not a
  separate git-tag push, which this repo has never used for dataset
  versions). Zips `releases/data/<version>/` (CSVs + `images/`) with
  `manifest.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` — matching `CLAUDE.md`'s "Release
  package" contents — writes a `sha256sum` checksum file, and publishes
  both as a `data-v<version>`-tagged GitHub Release via `gh release
  create` (preinstalled on GitHub-hosted runners, no third-party action).
  Also runnable via `workflow_dispatch` to (re-)publish a specific
  version. Verified end-to-end against the real `releases/data/0.2.0/`
  (330 files, 11MB zip) with a stubbed `gh` binary, and the added-manifest
  diff logic against a synthetic git history.
- [x] Backlog #29 + #30: Usage-tab Trends subtab — a tournament-date
  filter (`#usage-trend-date-filter`, most recent date selected by
  default) over `pokemon_usage_by_event_date`, plus each Pokémon's usage-
  share *change* versus the immediately preceding tournament date as a
  `▲/▼ Npp` badge (new `.badge-positive`/`.badge-negative` variants,
  reusing the already-defined `--positive`/`--danger` tokens) or a `NEW`
  badge for a Pokémon absent from that previous date — the dependency-free
  stand-in for a line chart both entries flagged as the option once
  Chart.js was removed. Verified against a real `extract all` + `dbt
  build` + `build-dashboard` run: 26 real tournament dates, correct deltas
  and `NEW` badges at a mid-range date, all `—` (no false `NEW`s) at the
  earliest date, zero browser console errors. Also caught and documented a
  real, pre-existing bug while doing that verification: backlog #49, every
  bps-based validation-report metric (coverage/null-rate) reads `0.0` on a
  passing check due to a dbt-core behavior this project's `report.py`
  didn't account for — status/gating is unaffected, but the reported
  numbers have been wrong since the ratio pattern was introduced.

## Analytics depth (backlog Section 1, "buildable today")

Six of the "no new data required" items from `docs/backlog.md`'s Section
1 — the highest value-to-effort ratio in the backlog since every input
already existed in the normalized layer. Verified against a real,
freshly-run `extract all` + `dbt build` pass (not just synthetic
fixtures); all 91 dbt nodes (30 external models, 6 seeds, 35 data tests, 20
view models) pass, and `reports/validation/validation_report.json` reports
zero `release_blocking_findings`. None of the six are wired into the
dashboard UI yet (`pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s `MART_FIELDS` and
`docs/dashboard.md`) — that's separate, still-open follow-up work; see each
item's `docs/backlog.md` entry.

- [x] Backlog #12: Usage × regulation cross-tab — new
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_usage_by_regulation.sql`. `tournament_event`
  carries no `regulation_code` of its own, so this isn't a temporal "usage
  during regulation X" slice; it cross-joins `pokemon_usage_summary`'s
  overall `usage_count` against `legality_snapshot`'s regulation membership
  at the latest `snapshot_date`, with `usage_share`/`usage_rank`
  recomputed within each `regulation_code` partition.
- [x] Backlog #14: Item and build concentration metrics — new
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_build_concentration.sql`: a
  Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (sum of squared shares) over
  `pokemon_item_usage.item_share`/`pokemon_ability_usage.ability_share`
  per Pokémon, plus how many distinct items/abilities were observed.
- [x] Backlog #13: Win-rate confidence intervals —
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_win_rate_summary.sql` gained
  `wilson_lower_bound` (95% Wilson score CI lower bound) and `wilson_rank`
  columns; `pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s `compute_kpis` now picks the
  KPI card's `top_win_rate_pokemon` by `wilson_rank` instead of the old
  `RECORD_COUNT_FLOOR = 5`-filter-then-max-`win_rate` heuristic (removed).
  Verified against real data: the old logic picked a 63%-over-3-matches
  outlier; the new logic correctly picks a 50.6%-over-2,384-matches
  Pokémon instead.
- [x] Backlog #8: Placement-weighted usage — new
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_placement_weighted_usage.sql`, using
  `tournament_team.placement` (lower is better): a hard top-8-cutoff view
  (`top_cut_usage_count`/`top_cut_usage_share`) and a continuous
  inverse-placement-weighted view (`placement_weighted_score`/
  `weighted_usage_share`), so "successful" and "popular" are both
  answerable, not just the latter.
- [x] Backlog #6: Usage over time from `tournament_event.event_date` — new
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_usage_by_event_date.sql`: usage count/share/
  rank per Pokémon x event_date, a real meta-over-time view that doesn't
  need multiple extraction snapshots (Blocker A). Verified against real
  data: 2,073 rows across the real MunchStats event-date history.
- [x] Backlog #9: Team synergy beyond raw co-occurrence — new
  `dbt/models/marts/pokemon_team_synergy.sql`: lift per Pokémon x partner
  pair (`P(A,B) / (P(A) x P(B))`) built on top of
  `pokemon_team_core_usage`'s mirrored pairs, with `pair_team_count`
  exposed since lift is noisy at low counts. Verified against real data
  (10,336 pair rows) that lift surfaces a genuinely different, less
  generically-popular partner set than raw co-occurrence does. Extended on
  2026-08-09 with `pokemon_team_core_triple_usage`: canonical three-member
  cores with support, expected share, triple lift, constituent pair lift,
  event/player coverage, placement, and win-rate context; Pokémon Profile
  now switches between pair and triple cores.
- [x] Backlog #15: Experimental data-derived archetypes — qualifying triple
  cores consolidate when they share two members; every matched team gets a
  primary assignment and only a near-tied (>=90%) secondary assignment.
  `detected_archetype_summary` feeds a neutral-name dashboard view while the
  curated seed remains available for comparison. Against release 0.3.0,
  2,940/3,048 Champions teams receive a primary assignment and 38 groups
  span multiple events; the dashboard shows the top 24 cross-event groups.

## Backlog #25-#27 — the last three blocked items (2026-08-03)

The three items `docs/backlog.md` had recorded as permanently blocked on
missing sources. Checking each against the live source rather than against
its own description resolved all three; two of the three blockers were
stale. See `docs/backlog.md` #25-#27 for the full write-ups.

- [x] Backlog #27: real head-to-head matchups via RK9 — the entry said "no
  signal to derive this from," but named the answer itself
  ("round-by-round pairing data from tournament software") without
  following it up. That software is RK9, already this dataset's upstream
  via MunchStats, and it serves pairings over plain HTTP
  (`rk9.gg/pairings/{event_id}?pod={p}&rnd={n}`). No event-level ID mapping
  was needed: MunchStats reuses RK9's own event ids, so
  `tournament_event.event_id` *is* the pairings key. New
  `pipelines/extract/rk9.py` (rounds enumerated from the division tab strip,
  **not** the fragments' `hx-get` attributes — the active round is rendered
  inline and has none, so reading only those drops every event's final
  round), new normalized entity `tournament_match` with four release gates,
  and new `pokemon_head_to_head`/`pokemon_matchup_summary` marts surfaced in
  the dashboard's Matchup tab. Verified against real data: 13,201 matches
  across the three Champions events (13,127 decided, 69 byes, 5 ties),
  99.8% of 24,139 Masters pairing slots resolved to a `team_id`, and
  competitively sensible output (Incineroar's worst matchup is Lycanroc-Dusk
  at 39.1% over 289 matches). Honest limit, stated in every consumer: the
  grain is *team vs team* — no source names which four of six Pokémon were
  brought, so figures are attributed to the whole roster.
- [x] Backlog #26: Limitless VGC — both stated blockers were false (it needs
  no browser automation; it is server-rendered) and so was its value
  statement (it does *not* extend Champions history — only three Champions
  events exist anywhere, and MunchStats had all three; per event Limitless
  is narrower, publishing the day-2 cut only). Built for its real value
  instead: canonical shared team identity (`team_list`/`team_list_member`,
  359 compositions, 44 fielded by more than one player) and independent
  cross-validation of MunchStats rosters (`roster_source_agreement`). That
  validation earned its keep immediately — it reported **0% exact
  agreement** on first run, surfacing a real modelling error where Limitless
  publishes the base species holding its Mega Stone while MunchStats
  publishes the evolved form, so Limitless rows were joining to
  base-species stats. Fixed via a `limitless_mega_item_to_pokeapi_form`
  seed; agreement is now 97.9-100% exact, 99.2-100% per slot.
- [x] Backlog #25: EV spreads via Victory Road — **resolved as
  unbuildable**, and the entry's other justification turned out to be a
  measurement artifact hiding a real bug. EVs are not published by any
  source: official team sheets (RK9's own, which every source here derives
  from) carry ability, item, nature and moves and nothing more, verified
  directly against both `rk9.gg/teamlist/public/...` and
  `limitlessvgc.com/teams/...`. Victory Road is separately unreachable
  (`victory-road.com` has no DNS record at all; the real
  `victoryroadvgc.com` is permitted by egress policy but its origin resets
  the TLS handshake), but that is beside the point.
- [x] The "MunchStats nature coverage is only ~17%" claim (documented in
  five files) was **not** a coverage gap: 17.2% is the Champions *share* of
  a corpus that also held standard VGC events. Within Champions, nature is
  100% and `tera_type` is 0%; standard VGC is the exact reverse. Root cause:
  `tournament_event` never captured `format`, so every usage and win-rate
  mart silently blended two different games. Fixed by threading
  `event_format` through extraction and adding
  `dbt/models/intermediate/int_champions_roster.sql`, which all 14
  roster-derived marts now read. The correction is large and visible:
  Incineroar drops from #1 (7,641 appearances) to #5 (1,029), and
  Gholdengo/Dragonite/Whimsicott/Farigiraf leave the Champions top 8
  entirely. Consequently `pokemon_tera_type_usage` is permanently empty for
  Champions and was removed (backlog #10 reopened), following the same
  precedent as the stat-change leaderboard and legal-pool trend sections.

## Release readiness (v1 definition of done)

All release gates pass as of this writing (see
`reports/validation/validation_report.json`: `release_blocking_findings: []`)
and **`dataset_version 0.3.0` has been published** (the current latest;
`0.1.0` was the first release, `0.2.0` the first with Bulbagarden data) —
`releases/data/0.3.0/*.csv`, `releases/manifests/manifest-0.3.0.json`,
`releases/changelogs/CHANGELOG-0.3.0.md`. 0.3.0 is a MINOR bump: it adds
the `tournament_match`, `team_list` and `team_list_member` entities
(backlog #26/#27) with no breaking changes to existing ones, and is the
first release whose usage figures are scoped to the Champions format
(backlog #25 — see that section above; the corrected numbers differ
substantially from 0.2.0's).

Cutting it also fixed a real, previously-unhit bug in
`pipelines/release/build.py`: `SOURCES` still pointed at pre-backlog-#1 flat
staging paths (`data/staging/pokeapi.csv`), which no longer exist now that
snapshots are date-partitioned, so `_build_sources` would have raised
`FileNotFoundError` for every source. It went unnoticed because no release
had been cut since that change landed.

- [x] Coverage: >=95% of OP.GG legal pool mapped to canonical `pokemon_id`
  (currently 98.4%, 312/317 legal-pool rows)
- [x] Coverage: >=90% of targeted tournament records mapped to normalized team
  tables (currently ~99.9%)
- [x] Coverage: >=95% of PokéBase legal-pool rows mapped to canonical
  `pokemon_id` (currently ~98.7%, 306/310 rows)
- [x] Data quality: required-field null rate <=1% for core tables (all nine
  pass, including `legality_snapshot` now that `regulation_code` is real —
  nine since `pokemon_asset` joined the core entity list in Phase 4)

- [x] Export: versioned CSV outputs for all core entities (`pipelines/release/build.py`,
  `python -m pipelines.cli release --version X.Y.Z`) — twelve tables as of
  0.3.0
- [x] Export: versioned JSON manifest with source lineage and run stats (same
  command; also writes `releases/changelogs/CHANGELOG-<version>.md`)
- [x] Validate example analysis queries (`dbt/analyses/`, see its `README.md`):
  top stat gainers/losers and most-used legal Pokémon both validated with
  real, non-degenerate results; largest legal-pool changes by regulation is
  structurally validated but still currently degenerate for a narrower
  reason now — `regulation_code` is populated, but there's only one
  extraction run (one `snapshot_date`) so far to diff against

## Deferred (post-v1)

No sources remain deferred. Both former entries were resolved on
2026-08-03: Limitless VGC was brought into scope (for shared team identity
and cross-source validation, not the historical coverage it was deferred
for), and Victory Road was closed as unbuildable — the EV data it was
wanted for is published by no source at all. RK9.gg was added in the same
pass to supply match-level results. See "Formerly deferred sources" and
"Added sources" in `dataset-spec.md`.
