# Dashboard UX Design System

This is the design system for `pipelines/dashboard/` — the static
analytics dashboard described in `docs/dashboard.md`. It documents the
design tokens, component patterns, and Pokémon-representation/data
conventions the dashboard's HTML/CSS/JS (`templates/index.html.jinja`,
`static/app.js` + `static/matchup.js` + `static/teams.js`) implement, so
future additions stay visually and behaviorally consistent instead of
drifting per-tab. Where docs/dashboard.md
covers *architecture* (how the site is built and published), this document
covers *design*: what things look like, how Pokémon data is named and
ordered, and what a new component should reuse rather than reinvent.

This is a living document — when a new component or convention is added to
the dashboard, update this file in the same change.

## Design tokens

All tokens live as CSS custom properties on `:root` in
`templates/index.html.jinja`. Nothing in the stylesheet should hardcode a
color, spacing, or radius value that already has a token — add one instead.

### Color

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--navy` | `#16264d` | Primary text, borders |
| `--blue` | `#2b5cad` | Interactive accents (active tab, links, bars) |
| `--light-blue` | `#eaf1fb` | Subtle fills (empty states, table dividers, badge backgrounds) |
| `--muted` | `#5b6b8c` | Secondary text (labels, sub-text) |
| `--bg` | `#f4f6fb` | Page background |
| `--surface` | `#fff` | Card/section background |
| `--positive` / `--positive-bg` | `#1f8a4c` / `#e8f7ee` | Reserved for future positive-delta indicators (e.g. a stat gainer, once `stat_change_leaderboard` has real deltas — see "Removed sections" in `docs/dashboard.md`) |
| `--warning` / `--warning-bg` | `#a8710a` / `#fbf1e0` | Caution states; the Matchup tab's "not very effective" (0.5×) type-effectiveness tile |
| `--danger` / `--danger-bg` | `#b23434` / `#fbe9e9` | Destructive actions (Team Builder's remove button), Blazing speed tier, the Matchup tab's "4× weak" type-effectiveness tile |
| `--panel-dark` | `#12131a` | Broadcast color-block section/page header background (see "Broadcast color-block header" below) |
| `--accent-red` / `--accent-red-bg` | `#e3323c` / `#fce7e8` | Broadcast accent: active tab, `.grid-6xn` leader tile |
| `--accent-gold` | `#f4b942` | Broadcast accent: reserved for #1-rank/MVP highlighting |

Speed-tier colors (`--speed-blazing`, `--speed-fast`, `--speed-average`,
`--speed-slow`, each with a `-bg` pair) are documented under "Speed-tier
badge" below rather than here, since they're paired directly with the
bucketing thresholds.

### Icon size scale

Four tokens (three plus one deliberate exception) replace what used to be
four ad-hoc pixel values scattered across the stylesheet/JS (40px KPI
sprite, 32px roster picker, 24px table cell, 22px chart axis):

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--icon-sm` | 40px | Table/list cells, `.grid-6xn` tiles, speed-order rows (`ICON_SIZES.sm` in `app.js`) |
| `--icon-md` | 64px | Roster picker rows, `.grid-6xn` tiles (`ICON_SIZES.md`) |
| `--icon-lg` | 96px | KPI hero sprite, team slot, Pokémon Profile hero (`ICON_SIZES.lg`) |
| `--icon-xl` | 128px | Pokémon Profile's dual-type badge only (`ICON_SIZES.xl`) — see "Type badge" below |

**Every sprite/item/type image must use one of these tokens** (or the
matching `ICON_SIZES` constant in JS) — no other pixel value. `--icon-xl`
is a deliberate single-purpose exception, not a general-use size: it
exists because the Profile header's type display is new, hero-level
information (docs' "add descriptions and larger type" ask), not because
the sm/md/lg floor moved. Everywhere else still uses sm/md/lg.

**Sprites render at native resolution, smoothed, not pixelated.** Every
sprite-bearing element (`.kpi-sprite`, `.cell-icon`, `.grid-6xn-tile img`,
`.team-slot img`) used to force `image-rendering: pixelated` (a deliberate
"retro pixel art" look) — this was dropped, along with the tier bump
above, so upscaling the source art looks smooth rather than blocky. This
enlarges and de-pixelates at the *existing* Bulbagarden source
resolution; it isn't a switch to a higher-resolution image source (no
such source is wired up in this repo today).

### Spacing

A 4px base scale: `--space-1` (4px) through `--space-8` (32px). Prefer the
token nearest the ad-hoc pixel value you'd otherwise write.

### Radius

`--radius-sm` (6px, buttons/inputs/table containers), `--radius-md` (10px,
cards/sections/team slots), `--radius-pill` (999px, badges).

### Type scale

`--font-xs` (0.8rem, badges/sub-text) through `--font-2xl` (1.6rem, page
title). Body copy defaults to the browser's system font stack
(`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`) — no
webfont, keeping the page dependency-free.

## Layout primitives

- **`header`** — page title + generation timestamp, centered, white text on
  a `--panel-dark` color-blocked background (the broadcast/esports theme's
  most visible landmark — see "Broadcast color-block header" below).
- **`main`** — centered content column, `max-width: 1100px`.
- **`.kpi-row`** — responsive grid of `.kpi-card`s (`auto-fit,
  minmax(200px, 1fr)`), always the first thing under the header.
- **`.tabs` / `.tab-btn` / `.tab-panel`** — client-side tab navigation
  (`app.js`'s `setupTabs`/`registerTab`). Every dashboard view beyond the
  KPI row lives in a tab, not a scrolling section — this was a deliberate
  M6 redesign decision (see `docs/todo.md`'s "Dashboard full redesign"
  entry) to keep the page scannable as views are added. Current tabs:
  Overview, Usage, Pokémon Profile, Speed Tiers, Matchup, Team Builder, Top
  Teams. Archetypes and Regulations were removed in the competitive-UX
  redesign pass (see "Removed tabs" below); Matchup and Top Teams are new.
  Each tab's setup function is registered via `App.registerTab(tabId, fn)`
  and still runs lazily, on first activation — `app.js` owns the
  Overview/Usage/Pokémon Profile/Speed Tiers tabs directly, while
  `matchup.js` and `teams.js` (loaded right after `app.js`, sharing its
  helpers/data via `window.DashboardApp`) register Matchup and Team
  Builder/Top Teams respectively. Splitting the JS this way keeps any one
  file from growing unbounded as tabs are added.
- **`section` (`.tab-panel`)** — a bordered white card per tab, `h2` title
  rendered as a broadcast color-block header, optional `.controls` filter
  row, then content following the "3-tier tab layout convention" below.
- **`.subtabs` / `.subtab-btn` / `.subtab-panel`** — a compact pill row
  nested *inside* one top-level tab (`app.js`'s `setupSubTabs`), for
  several equally-important views that would otherwise stack vertically
  within one section. Deliberately lighter-weight than `.tabs` (a rounded
  pill row, not an underlined bar) so it reads as a sub-navigation, not
  another top-level tab strip — `.tabs` stays reserved for the page's
  seven main tabs. Two uses today: the **Usage** tab's Usage-leaders/
  Win-rate-leaders tables (previously two stacked `h2` sections), and the
  **Pokémon Profile** tab's Items/Ability/Moves/Team Cores (previously
  four stacked `.grid-6xn`s under separate `h3`s). Wired the same way as
  `.tabs`: buttons carry `data-subtab`, panels carry `data-subpanel`,
  matched by id, defaulting to the first button.

### 3-tier tab layout convention

Every tab panel (beyond the page-level KPI row, which is its own thing)
follows the same three tiers, top to bottom:

1. **Filters/mini-stats** — the `.controls` row: tier/type/role/range
   filters, a Pokémon picker, whatever inputs that tab needs. Not every
   tab needs this tier (Overview has none).
2. **`.grid-6xn`** — the primary visual, a 6-wide grid of ranked tiles.
   This is the tier that actually answers "what's the headline data here"
   at a glance.
3. **Detail table** *(optional)* — a full sortable `<table>` for raw
   drill-down beyond what the grid's top ~18 rows show. Only present where
   it adds something the grid doesn't: Usage keeps both a Usage-leaders and
   a Win-rate-leaders table, now as two `.subtabs` panels rather than two
   stacked sections (see "Sub-tabs" above); Overview has no table tier at
   all, since its job is the headline Top 12, not a full leaderboard
   (that's what the Usage tab is for) — this is also why Overview's old
   Top 30 ranked list was removed rather than converted to a grid.

Not every tab needs all three tiers — Pokémon Profile, Matchup, and Team
Builder are Pokémon/team-drill-down views built around a picker rather
than a leaderboard, so they use tier 2 (grids/tables) repeatedly without a
tier-3 table. Pokémon Profile's four tier-2 views (Items/Ability/Moves/
Team Cores) are sub-tabbed rather than stacked (see "Sub-tabs" above), so
only one is visible at a time.

## Component catalog

### KPI card

`.kpi-card`: a bordered white card with an optional `--icon-lg` (96px)
sprite, a `.label` (uppercase, muted, small), a `.value` (bold, large,
wraps rather than overflows for long names), and an optional `.sub`
(muted, small) for supporting detail like a percentage or date. Used only
in the top `.kpi-row` — don't reuse this class for in-tab summary stats;
use `.stat-summary-row .stat` instead (see Team Builder below), which is
denser and doesn't compete visually with the page-level KPIs.

### Leaderboard table

The recurring pattern for "top N Pokémon by some metric" (Usage leaders,
Win rate leaders, Speed Tiers): a
`<table>` inside `.table-scroll`, first column a `.badge.badge-rank`
(`#1`, `#2`, …), second column a `pokemonCell()`-rendered sprite+name,
remaining columns the metric(s). Columns with `<th class="sortable"
data-sort-key="...">` are click-to-sort (`makeSortableTable()` in
`app.js`, toggling ascending/descending, `▲`/`▼` indicator appended to the
active header) — every leaderboard table added since the broadcast
redesign uses this; a table's *default* order (before any header click)
is still descending by its primary relevance metric, per "Ordering
convention" below.

### Badge

`.badge`: a small pill (`--radius-pill`, `--font-xs`, bold). Two variants
today:
- `.badge-rank` — neutral blue-on-light-blue, used for leaderboard rank.
- `.badge-speed-*` — see "Speed-tier badge" below.

Add new badge variants as `.badge-<name>` with a token-backed color pair,
not one-off inline styles.

### Sprite / icon cell

`pokemonCell(pokemonKey, pokemonName)` (in `app.js`) is the canonical way
to render a Pokémon in a table cell: an `--icon-sm` (40px) sprite (from the
`sprites` map, keyed by `pokemon_key`) next to the display name, wrapped in
`.cell-with-icon`. `itemCell()` follows the same pattern for held items.
**Any new table or list that references a specific Pokémon should use
`pokemonCell()` (or `spriteImg()` directly for non-table contexts, as
Team Builder's roster list and team slots do) rather than rendering a bare
name** — see "Representing Pokémon" below.

### 6-wide grid (`.grid-6xn`)

`renderGrid6xn(container, rows, opts)` (in `app.js`) is the dashboard's
**only** data-visualization component, and the one every usage/win-rate
metric renders through — it replaced both Chart.js (removed in the
original broadcast redesign) and the ranked-list bar component that
redesign introduced (dashboard "replace usage/win-rate bar charts with a
6-wide grid just like Overview" ask; Overview's old Top-12 spotlight grid
became the template every other view now follows). Each `.grid-6xn-tile`
shows: an optional rank badge (`.badge-rank`, normal document flow and
left-aligned via `align-self: flex-start` — **not** absolutely positioned,
which would overlap the label whenever a tile has no icon), an optional
icon (`keyFn` → sprite lookup, or `iconFn` for a direct icon src like a
move-type or item icon), a label, a **bolded** headline value
(`.grid-6xn-value`, `font-weight: 800` — the "bold the percentage" ask),
and an optional `subFn` second line (a description, a sample-size note, a
secondary stat). The #1 tile gets `.is-leader` (`--accent-red` border/
text). Fixed 6 columns on desktop (`repeat(6, 1fr)`, not auto-fill/
auto-fit), collapsing to 3 at 720px and 2 at 480px.

Used by: Overview's Top 12, Usage's usage-share and win-rate grids,
Pokémon Profile's Items/Ability/Moves/Team-Cores sections, Speed Tiers,
Matchup's co-usage panel, and Top Teams' leaderboard. Any new "top N by
metric" visual should use this — there is no other charting/ranking
component in the dashboard, and the old ranked-list component (`.ranked-
row`, `renderRankedList`) was deleted outright once nothing referenced it
anymore rather than kept "just in case." (`.ranked-value`, a small muted
inline-annotation style, survives on its own — the Win rate leaders
table's `(n=X)` sample-size note still uses it — but it's unrelated to the
deleted ranked-list row component now.)

### Broadcast color-block header

Section (`<h2>`) and page (`<header>`) titles are uppercase, `font-weight:
800`, `letter-spacing: 0.04em`, white text on a `--panel-dark` bar — this,
plus the `--accent-red`/`--accent-gold` accent tokens, is what gives the
dashboard its broadcast/esports look (dashboard "more Pokémon-like
features" ask). Deliberately **not** a webfont change — the effect comes
entirely from color-blocking and weight/case, preserving the
dependency-free-page convention "Type scale" above already established.

### Filter control

`.controls label` — a small-caps muted label wrapping a `<select>` or
`input[type=text]`. Selects default to `font-size: 16px` specifically to
prevent iOS Safari's auto-zoom-on-focus; keep that when adding new inputs
(see Team Builder's search box).

### Empty state

`.empty-state` — light-blue rounded box, muted text. Used for the
Overview tab's explanatory copy today; also the pattern to reach for if a
future view needs a "not enough data yet" message (see `docs/dashboard.md`'s
"Removed sections" — this is what the stat-change leaderboard and
legal-pool-trend sections would use if/when they're reintroduced).

### Buttons

`.btn` — bordered, `--radius-sm`, hover fills `--light-blue`. `.btn-primary`
is the solid-blue variant, used for a page's one clearly-primary action
(Top Teams' "Load into Team Builder" pokepaste-import button). `.btn-remove`
is a borderless text-only danger-colored button (Team Builder's per-slot
remove). `.btn-sm` is a compact size modifier (Team Builder's "Add"/
"Clear team"/"Export as pokepaste text" buttons).

### Speed-tier badge

Buckets a Pokémon's Champions-format base Speed stat
(`pokemon_champions_profile.speed`) into four bands, each rendered as a
`.badge-speed-*` pill. Thresholds live in `app.js`'s `SPEED_TIERS`
constant — **this table must stay in sync with that constant**:

| Tier | Speed range | Badge color |
|---|---|---|
| Blazing | ≥ 120 | danger red |
| Fast | 90–119 | warning amber |
| Average | 60–89 | blue |
| Slow | ≤ 59 | muted gray |

These bands are a display/UX bucketing of real Champions-format speed
data, not a separate data source — no new extraction or fabricated values
are involved. They're intentionally coarse (four bands) rather than
per-point tiers, since Champions' actual competitive speed-tier list
changes as the legal pool and rebalances change; the dashboard's job is to
make the real numbers scannable, not to assert a definitive competitive
tier list.

### Team slot / roster item

Two small, Team-Builder-specific patterns:
- `.team-slot` — a bordered card (filled, `--icon-lg` sprite) or dashed
  placeholder (`.empty`) representing one of the team's 6 roster
  positions. A filled slot's `.slot-detail` line shows its base stats,
  plus an item `<select>`, an ability `<select>`, and four move
  `<select>`s — a real build, not a read-only display — see "Team
  Builder" below for where that data comes from and how the selects are
  populated/capped.
- `.roster-item` — a horizontal row (`--icon-md` sprite, name,
  usage/win-rate/speed sub-text, Add button) in the scrollable "Legal
  pool" picker list, filterable by the type-filter chip row above it.

### Item / Ability / Move separation (Pokémon Profile)

The Pokémon Profile tab shows four separate views — one per `.subtabs`
panel (see "Sub-tabs" above), not stacked — instead of one combined
item×ability×move build table: **Items** (top 5, `pokemon_item_usage`,
`.grid-6xn`), **Ability** (top 5, `pokemon_ability_usage`, `.grid-6xn`),
**Moves** (top 15, `pokemon_move_usage`, a full sortable `<table>` — see
below), and **Team Cores** (`.grid-6xn`, teammate co-usage) — each capped
independently rather than sharing one table's row budget. The Items/
Ability grid tiles' `subFn` shows that item/ability's `short_effect`
description text (PokéAPI, joined in dbt — see `docs/dataset-spec.md`'s
`item_detail`/`ability_detail` entities).

**Moves is a table, not a grid** — real game mechanics need columns, not
tiles: Move (with its own type icon — `move_type`, real per-move data,
not a name-matched lookup, see "Removed: the move-types seed lookup"
below), Usage %, Category, Power, Accuracy, PP, Priority, and Effect
(`short_effect`), all joined from `move_detail` (PokéAPI) via
`pokemon_move_usage`, sortable via the same `makeSortableTable` every
other detail table uses. This replaced an earlier `.grid-6xn` tile
version that only surfaced name/usage-share/one line of effect text —
accuracy/PP/category/priority existed in the underlying data
(`move_detail`) all along but weren't selected into the mart or shown
anywhere.

**Removed: the move-types seed lookup.** Before this pass, a move's type
icon came from `dbt/seeds/pokeapi_move_types.csv` (a static name-matched
lookup, still used by `pipelines/render/`'s team-card renderer) via
`build.py`'s `_move_types_for()`/`payload["move_types"]`. Now that
`pokemon_move_usage` carries real `move_type` from `move_detail`
(PokéAPI, joined in dbt) for every move it lists, that duplicate lookup
path was deleted from the dashboard build entirely — `app.js` reads
`row.move_type` straight off the mart row.

### Default selection, not an empty state (Pokémon Profile)

The Pokémon Profile picker defaults to the highest-`usage_share` Pokémon on
tab open (`setupPokemonProfile()` in `app.js` sets `select.value` to
`sortedProfiles[0]` before its first `render()` call) rather than opening
on an empty "select a Pokémon" state. Decided, not an oversight
(backlog.md #34, which flagged this as an open call): every other tab in
this dashboard shows ranked content immediately on open — Overview's Top
12, Usage's leaderboard, Team Builder's legal-pool picker sorted by usage
— matching the "Ordering convention" section's descending-by-relevance
default throughout. A blank Profile panel on first load would be the one
tab that asks a visitor to act before showing them anything, breaking that
pattern for no real benefit. `.empty-state` still covers the case an
empty state actually serves: `render()` shows it if `chosenName` somehow
resolves to no matching profile row (e.g. a stale selection after the
underlying marts changed), not as the tab's default.

### Type badge

Pokémon type display (`pokemon.type_1`/`type_2`, sourced from PokéAPI —
previously nonexistent in this pipeline; see `docs/dataset-spec.md`'s
`pokemon` entity). `renderTypeBadgeRow(container, type1, type2, large)` in
`app.js` renders one of two variants, both reusing the 18 committed
move-type icons in `static/icons/types/` (the same icon set move types
already used — no new asset work). Both variants are **icon-only
emblems** — no visible type-name text — with the type name exposed via
`role="img"`/`aria-label` on the pill and a `title` attribute on the icon
itself, so the badge stays accessible/hoverable without a text label
cluttering it.

**The source PNGs are wide "icon + type name" badges (200x40), not bare
square icons** — a PokéAPI/sprites generation-ix asset with the symbol in
a fixed-width square on the left edge and the type name filling the rest.
Squishing the whole 5:1 image into a square (an earlier approach) just
stretched the text into an illegible blob. `typeIconImg()` instead crops
to that left square via `.type-icon-crop` (an `overflow:hidden` window
sized to the target icon size, holding a height-constrained `<img>` that
scales to its natural ~5:1 aspect so only the icon shows) — every
type-icon use gets this crop, including the filter chips and Matchup
effectiveness grid below, which keep their own separate text label
alongside the now-icon-only symbol instead of the old doubled-up
icon-with-baked-in-text-plus-a-second-text-label.
- **Compact** (`large=false`): `.type-pill`, an 18px cropped type icon.
  Used in the Matchup tab's attacker/defender panels.
- **Large** (`large=true`): `.type-badge-lg .type-pill-lg`, a `--icon-xl`
  (128px) cropped icon. Used once, in the Pokémon Profile header — the
  one place in the dashboard that uses `--icon-xl` (see "Icon size scale"
  above).

Not icon-only: the type-filter chip row (`renderTypeFilterChips`, Usage/
Speed Tiers/Team Builder) and the Matchup tab's type-effectiveness grid
tiles both keep their visible type-name text — chips are pickers (a user
needs to read what they're selecting) and effectiveness tiles are a
lookup table (every row must be identifiable at a glance), so dropping
text there would make the UI worse, not better.

### Gallery card (Pro Team Gallery)

`.gallery-card`: a bordered card wrapping a pre-rendered team-card PNG
(`pipelines/render/`, see `docs/dashboard.md`'s "Pro Team Gallery"
section) plus a caption (player name, country, event, placement,
archetype tag) and a "Load into my builder" button that copies the
gallery team's Pokémon into Team Builder. Laid out in `.gallery-grid`
(`auto-fill, minmax(220px, 1fr)`). Moved to the **Top Teams** tab in the
competitive-UX redesign (previously lived inside the Team Builder tab) —
grouped there with the real `top_tournament_teams` leaderboard and the
pokepaste import box, since all three are "look at/import teams" features,
distinct from the roster-assembly tool Team Builder itself is. Still
visually and functionally distinct from Team Builder's own roster planner
and never itself called "Team Builder" — "Load into my builder" calls the
same `addToTeam`/`ensureTeamBuilder()` pipeline the pokepaste importer
uses (see "Team Builder" below).

### Removed tabs and components

The Archetype Explorer and Regulation Comparison tabs (and their
`.archetype-card`/`.archetype-grid` and regulation-comparison-table
markup) were removed outright in the competitive-UX redesign pass, per
explicit request — Archetypes were always curated editorial judgment
rather than sourced data (a documented exception to this repo's
"provenance is mandatory" convention), and Regulation Comparison's
cumulative-legal-pool caveat made it a lower-value tab than the rest.
`legality_summary_by_regulation` is still loaded (it feeds the page-level
"Legal Pool" KPI card), but has no dedicated tab anymore. `pokemon_
archetype_usage`/`archetype_summary` and the `archetype_pokemon_map` seed
are untouched at the data layer — only the dashboard's consumption of them
was removed — in case a future pass wants to reintroduce archetype context
elsewhere (e.g. as a Team Builder tag) without re-deriving the mapping.

## Representing Pokémon

Every dashboard view that names a specific Pokémon must show its sprite
alongside its name wherever there's room for one (table row, grid tile,
tooltip, team slot, roster picker row) — see "Sprite / icon cell" and
"6-wide grid" above. A name-only Pokémon reference should only appear where
space genuinely doesn't allow an image (e.g. a `<select>` option's text).
Sprites come from Bulbagarden Archives via `pokemon_asset.csv`
(`docs/dashboard.md`'s "Icon sources"); a Pokémon with no resolvable sprite
degrades to text-only, never a broken image.

### Pokémon name formatting: PascalCase

Display names are **PascalCase**, derived from `pokemon_key` (PokéAPI's own
form slug, e.g. `landorus-therian`, `charizard-mega-x`) via
`pipelines/dashboard/data.py`'s `to_pascal_case()`:

```
landorus-therian    -> LandorusTherian
charizard-mega-x    -> CharizardMegaX
great-tusk           -> GreatTusk
urshifu-rapid-strike -> UrshifuRapidStrike
porygon-z            -> PorygonZ
```

This is computed once, server-side, when the dashboard payload is built
(`load_pokemon_names()`), so every consumer — KPI cards, every mart's
`pokemon_name` field, every `<select>` option — gets the identical string;
`app.js` never reformats a name itself.

Two things worth calling out about this choice:

- It's deliberately derived from **`pokemon_key`/`form_name`, not the raw
  `pokemon_name` column** in `data/normalized/pokemon.csv`. That column is
  the species-only name from PokéAPI (e.g. `landorus` for both
  Landorus-Incarnate and Landorus-Therian) — using it directly would make
  every alternate form of a species display identically and collide in
  any per-Pokémon list, table, or filter. Deriving from the form slug
  instead is what actually makes every legal Pokémon/form uniquely
  and correctly named.
- PascalCase (not Title Case with spaces, e.g. "Landorus Therian") is a
  deliberate, explicit convention for this dashboard, not an
  accident of using the raw slug. It keeps names compact in dense table
  cells and select options and gives every name a single unambiguous
  rendering with no hyphen/space/case inconsistency to normalize per
  view — while still reading as a proper noun (capitalized first letter),
  unlike a strict camelCase rendering would.

### Ordering convention

Pokémon-keyed lists default to **descending order by their most relevant
ranking metric**, not alphabetical — usage share for usage-oriented views,
win rate for win-rate-oriented views, speed for the Speed Tiers view. This
applies to every Pokémon-keyed list in the dashboard: leaderboard tables,
ranked lists, Team Builder's "Legal pool" picker (sortable between Usage /
Win rate / Speed, all descending) — **and now every Pokémon-picker
`<select>` dropdown too** (Pokémon Profile's picker), via
`distinctSortedByMetric()` in `app.js`, which orders by descending
`usage_share`.

This supersedes an earlier version of this convention that kept plain
`<select>` dropdowns alphabetical for findability — the dashboard has no
alphabetical Pokémon lists anywhere now; the ranked order is treated as
more useful than alphabetical scanning even in a dropdown. Non-Pokémon
selects (tournament tier) are unaffected and keep `distinctSorted()`'s
natural/alphabetical order, since there's no usage-relevance ranking that
applies to a tier name.

### Percentages, not raw counts

The dashboard shows **percentages/shares, not raw counts**, wherever a
share metric exists (dashboard "focus on percentages" ask):
`pokemon_usage_summary.usage_share`, `pokemon_item_usage.item_share`,
`pokemon_ability_usage.ability_share`, `pokemon_move_usage.move_share`,
`pokemon_team_core_usage.partner_share` — all computed in dbt (a `sum(x)
over (partition by ...)` window function per mart), not client-side, so
shares stay internally consistent. `pokemon_item_usage`/
`pokemon_ability_usage` replaced the old combined `pokemon_build_usage`
mart (see "Item / Ability / Move separation" below) — same share-of-own-
total pattern, just split by dimension instead of one item×ability pair.
Raw `usage_count`, `total_wins`/`total_losses`, and `co_occurrence_count`
are no longer displayed anywhere in the UI (they still exist in the
underlying CSVs for ranking/testing purposes).

The one deliberate exception is **win rate's sample size**: hiding
`record_count` entirely risked a 100% win rate on a single recorded match
reading as more authoritative than a well-established Pokémon's 51% on
thousands of matches, so the Win rate leaders table and its `record_count`
filter (see below) keep a small `(n=X)` annotation next to the percentage
— a minimum-record-count filter, not a raw-count column. Base stats
(Speed, HP, Attack, etc. on the Pokémon Profile tab) aren't percentages
and are unaffected by this convention — they're numbers with no
"share of a whole" meaning to convert to.

### Filters beyond Pokémon/tier

Beyond the tournament-tier filter (Usage tab) and the **minimum recorded
matches** threshold (Win rate leaders table,
`#win-rate-min-record-count-filter`, options 5/10/20/50 — the same
`RECORD_COUNT_FLOOR` idea `compute_kpis()`'s KPI card already used, now
user-adjustable), the competitive-UX redesign pass added:

- **Type filter** (`.type-filter-row` + `renderTypeFilterChips()` in
  `app.js`): a row of 18 toggle chips, one per type, multi-select (a
  Pokémon matches if *either* of its types is selected — `App.
  passesTypeFilter()`). An empty selection means no filter. Present on
  Usage, Speed Tiers, and Team Builder's roster picker. Only possible
  because this pass added real Pokémon type data (`pokemon.type_1`/
  `type_2`) — see "Type badge" above.
- **Role filter** (Usage tab, `#usage-role-filter`): Physical / Special /
  Mixed, derived client-side from `App.roleByKey()` — a UX bucketing over
  each Pokémon's own recorded moveset's damage-category split
  (`pokemon_move_usage.category`, weighted by `usage_count`; status-only
  moves don't count toward either side), the same "derived bucketing, not
  a sourced attribute" treatment as `SPEED_TIERS`.
- **Range filters** (`.range-filter`, paired `<input type="number">` +
  `App.inRange(value, minEl, maxEl)`): usage % and Speed on Usage; Speed on
  Speed Tiers. An empty min or max on either side means unbounded on that
  side.

The Archetype/Regulation-as-tabs pattern this section used to describe no
longer applies — both tabs were removed (see "Removed tabs and
components" above).

## Team Builder

A fully client-side (no backend, nothing uploaded) roster-assembly tool
(`setupTeamBuilder()` in `static/teams.js`, moved out of `app.js` in the
competitive-UX redesign pass alongside Top Teams — both need the same
`addToTeam` pipeline, see "Cross-tab team state" below), built on
`pokemon_champions_profile` (one row per currently-legal Pokémon with
Champions-format stats, type, and usage/win-rate). A visitor searches/
sorts/type-filters the legal pool, adds up to 6 to a team, and sees:

- their picks as filled **team slots** (empty slots shown as dashed
  placeholders). Each filled slot shows a compact stats readout
  (HP/Atk/Def/SpA/SpD/Spe) plus a real build, not just a read-only
  display: an **item `<select>`** (top 8 recorded, `pokemon_item_usage`),
  an **ability `<select>`** (top 5 recorded, `pokemon_ability_usage`), and
  **four move `<select>`s** (top 15 recorded pool, `pokemon_move_usage`,
  each excluding whatever the slot's other three move selects already
  chose so the same move can't be picked twice) — the "Team Builder
  move/item/ability selector" ask. Every select defaults to that Pokémon's
  top-recorded choice but is independently editable; `buildChoiceSelect()`
  in `teams.js` always keeps the slot's current value present as an option
  even if it falls outside the top-N cap (e.g. a pasted build), so editing
  or importing a team never silently drops what was chosen. There is
  deliberately no stat/EV/nature selector alongside these — see "Pokepaste
  import/export" below for why.
- a **speed order** list — their own picks, fastest-first, each tagged
  with its Speed-tier badge (see above) — the practical payoff of Team
  Builder and Speed Tiers pulling from the same
  `pokemon_champions_profile` mart: a team's speed order is just that
  mart filtered to the selected keys.
- a **summary row** (`.stat-summary-row`) of the team's average
  speed/usage share/win rate.
- an **"Export as pokepaste text"** button (`#team-builder-export`) —
  see "Pokepaste import/export" below.

The team selection persists to `localStorage` (key
`pokemonChampionsTeamBuilder`) purely so a reload doesn't lose it — it is
never sent to a server or embedded in the published HTML; this stays true
to the dashboard's "static site, no backend" architecture
(`docs/dashboard.md`'s "Stack decision").

### Cross-tab team state

Team Builder's team array, `addToTeam`/`removeFromTeam`/`loadTeam`, and
all of its rendering live inside `setupTeamBuilder()`'s closure — but two
other places need to push Pokémon into that same team: the Pro Team
Gallery's "Load into my builder" button and Top Teams' pokepaste importer
(both now live in the **Top Teams** tab, not Team Builder — see below).
Since tabs initialize lazily on first activation, a visitor could open Top
Teams and paste a team before ever opening Team Builder, at which point
`setupTeamBuilder()` wouldn't have run yet. `ensureTeamBuilder()` (module-
scoped in `teams.js`, not exported on `DashboardApp`, since only
`teams.js`'s own two tabs need it) handles this: it lazily calls
`setupTeamBuilder()` on first use from *either* tab and caches the
returned `{ addToTeam, loadTeam }` handle, so team state is correct
regardless of which of the two tabs a visitor opens first.

## Top Teams

A new tab (dashboard "include top teams" ask) with three sections:

1. **Top Teams leaderboard** — `.grid-6xn` fed by the new
   `top_tournament_teams` mart (real MunchStats data: one row per
   `tournament_team` with a reported win/loss record, ranked by win_rate,
   with its full roster). Distinct from the Pro Team Gallery below it:
   this is sourced tournament data, not curated/hand-authored.
2. **Pro Team Gallery** (see "Gallery card" above) — moved here from Team
   Builder.
3. **Pokepaste import** (`.pokepaste-box`, `#pokepaste-input`/
   `#pokepaste-load`/`#pokepaste-status`) — see "Pokepaste import/export"
   below.

### Pokepaste import/export

"Do it like vgcpastes/pokepaste": since this is a static site with no
backend, there's no way to fetch an arbitrary URL client-side (CORS), so
"paste a link" means paste the plain-text **Showdown export format** —
the same text a visitor would paste into pokepast.es itself to create a
paste, not a URL.

- **Import** (`parsePokepaste(text)` in `teams.js`): splits the pasted
  text on blank lines into per-Pokémon blocks, reads each block's first
  line (`Species [(Nickname)] [@ Item]`, tolerating a `(M)`/`(F)` gender
  marker) plus its `Ability: ...` line and `- Move` lines, and resolves
  the species name to a `pokemon_key` by normalizing both sides (strip
  spaces/hyphens/periods, lowercase) and matching against
  `DATA.pokemon_names`' PascalCase values — e.g. "Landorus-Therian" and
  "LandorusTherian" both normalize to "landorustherian". The pasted item/
  ability/moves are carried into that slot as-is (not just the species),
  so an imported team keeps its actual build rather than falling back to
  that Pokémon's top-recorded one. Unresolved species names are reported
  (not silently dropped) in `#pokepaste-status`, alongside how many
  Pokémon loaded.
- **Export** (`exportTeamAsPokepaste(teamSlots)` in `teams.js`): the
  reverse direction, for Team Builder's export button. Since the
  dashboard's own PascalCase display names (`LandorusTherian`) aren't
  real Showdown syntax, export re-derives a hyphenated Title Case name
  from `pokemon_key` instead (`keyToShowdownName()`: `landorus-therian` ->
  `Landorus-Therian`) — closer to real pokepaste convention, and a
  deliberately different transform from the dashboard's own display-name
  convention (see "Pokémon name formatting: PascalCase" above, which is
  unchanged for every other view). Each exported Pokémon uses that slot's
  actual chosen item/ability/moves (whatever its selects currently hold,
  defaulting to but not fixed at the top-recorded pick — see "Team
  Builder" above), not an EV spread or nature — MunchStats' nature
  coverage is only ~17% (see `docs/dashboard.md`'s "Pro Team Gallery"
  section), so it's omitted rather than guessed.

Neither direction is guaranteed to produce syntax that round-trips through
Pokémon Showdown itself byte-for-byte — this is a "pokepaste-style"
convenience for moving a team in and out of this dashboard's own Team
Builder, not a full Showdown-format implementation.

## Matchup

A new tab (dashboard "add matchup tab like Smogon" ask,
`static/matchup.js`) with three sections, all keyed off an
attacker/defender Pokémon pair (`<select>`s populated from
`pokemon_champions_profile`, ranked by usage per the ordering convention):

1. **Type effectiveness** (`.type-effect-grid`): all 18 attacking types'
   multiplier against the defender's type(s), color-coded tiles
   (`type-effect-4x/2x/1x/half/quarter/0x`).
2. **Damage calculator**: attacker/defender stat-stage sliders (-6..+6,
   Atk/SpA and Def/SpD), a weather `<select>`, and a curated row of
   item/ability toggle chips (`.toggle-chip`, reused from nowhere else —
   this is the first multi-select toggle-chip UI in the dashboard). Result
   shown in `.damage-result`, bolded per the "bold the percentage"
   convention.
3. **Co-usage** (`.grid-6xn`, `pokemon_team_core_usage` filtered to the
   defender): who the defender is most often teamed with in real
   tournament rosters — an explicitly-labeled **proxy**, not a real
   matchup-outcome signal (see the in-tab disclaimer copy and the scope
   note below).

### Matchup tab scope (read before extending)

The 18×18 type chart, weather-boost multipliers (rain/sun boost/halve
same-type moves; sandstorm boosts Rock's Sp. Def, snow boosts Ice's Def,
both by 1.5×), the stat-stage multiplier formula, and the curated item/
ability toggle list are **hardcoded game-mechanics constants** in
`matchup.js`, not dbt/staging data — they're universal Pokémon mechanics,
not per-record facts needing provenance, the same treatment `app.js`'s
`SPEED_TIERS` bucketing already gets. Pokémon *type* and move *power/
accuracy/category* **are** real sourced data (`pokemon.type_1`/`type_2`,
`move_detail` — PokéAPI, see `docs/dataset-spec.md`), which is what makes
a real (if simplified) calculator possible at all — see the "Still a real
gap" note in `dbt/models/marts/schema.yml` for why this was previously
listed as not-buildable.

Documented simplifications, not silent approximations:
- Stats are computed at **level 50, IV 31, EV 252** on whichever
  offensive/defensive stat the chosen move uses (`statAtLevel50()`/
  `hpAtLevel50()` in `matchup.js`) — a "maximally invested" baseline on
  both sides, not each Pokémon's actual real-tournament EV spread/nature
  (MunchStats' nature coverage is only ~17%, and EVs aren't reported at
  all).
- Only the curated `TOGGLES` list (Choice Band/Specs, Life Orb, Expert
  Belt, Huge Power/Pure Power, Adaptability, Technician, Intimidate) is
  modeled; no other item or ability affects the calculation.
- Status conditions (e.g. burn), critical hits, multi-hit moves, and
  terrain are **not** modeled at all.
- Damage calc only offers moves the attacker actually has recorded usage
  for (`pokemon_move_usage`) — there's no full per-species movepool data
  in this pipeline, only what's been seen in real tournament rosters.

If a future pass wants deeper mechanics fidelity, extend `TOGGLES` and
`computeDamage()` in `matchup.js` rather than adding new dbt models —
none of this is data-layer work.

## Responsive behavior

Breakpoints match `docs/dashboard.md`'s existing convention: 720px (KPI
grid drops to 2 columns, `.grid-6xn` drops to 3 columns, Team Builder's
two-column grid collapses to one column and its team-slot grid drops to 2
columns, the Matchup tab's attacker/defender panels stack) and 480px (KPI
cards stack vertically, `.grid-6xn` drops to 2 columns, filter selects go
full-width). Tables scroll horizontally inside `.table-scroll` rather than
reflowing — existing, unchanged convention.

## Backlog: not yet buildable

One explicitly-requested capability still isn't in this pass because the
underlying data doesn't exist in this dataset yet — adding it as a
frontend-only feature would mean fabricating data, which this repo's
"provenance is mandatory" convention (`CLAUDE.md`) rules out:

- **Real head-to-head battle-outcome matchups** ("what beats Pokémon X X%
  of the time in practice"). The type-effectiveness half of this gap is
  now closed (see the "Matchup" section above) — Pokémon type and move
  power/accuracy/category are real PokéAPI data now. What's still missing
  is individual battle-outcome data: MunchStats reports team rosters and a
  team's aggregate win/loss record, not per-battle results against a named
  opponent, so the Matchup tab's co-usage panel is an explicitly-labeled
  teammate-pairing *proxy*, not a real matchup-outcome signal. Closing this
  for real needs a battle-log source neither currently in scope nor
  deferred source (Limitless VGC, Victory Road) is confirmed to provide.
  Tracked in `docs/todo.md`'s M6 backlog.
- **Date-range filtering / trend charts.** Only one `snapshot_date` exists
  in the data so far, so a date-range control would have nothing to range
  over — see `docs/dashboard.md`'s "Removed sections" for the same
  degenerate-data reasoning applied to the earlier legal-pool-trend
  section. Tracked in `docs/todo.md`.

Sortable table columns and type-effectiveness (both previously listed
here as backlog) are now shipped — see "Leaderboard table" and "Matchup"
above.

See `docs/todo.md`'s M6 backlog section for the full, current list — this
document only calls out the items directly relevant to this pass's
design-system/Pokémon-representation scope.
